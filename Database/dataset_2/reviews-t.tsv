AE in Sales	SOCi (201-500 employees)	To tier my prospect list and make sure that I am only reaching out to potential buyers with somewhat warm intentions. By tiering my book based on intent data, I have better conversations with prospects knowing that they are actively looking for a tool and ideally speaking with the person searching.	Buyer intent; Increase conversion rate; Help drive revenue	Give me more leads!; Sometimes hard to navigate at the start; Sometimes prospects wouldn't know what I was talking about	It is well suited to highlight which accounts you should be targeting and for what reason. [...] sells different products, so tailoring my messaging to what they are searching for was MASSIVE. It was less suited for SMB because the timeline of searching and buying was faster. Sometimes when I called these folks, I was behind by a few months and they had already bought a solution.	2025-08-07
	Manager in Marketing (51-200 employees)	We mainly use 6sense for intent data, who is coming on to the website and visiting certain pages along with the Bombora and keyword intent. We're trying to get in front of certain accounts at the right time with the right message. The sales team uses the sales intelligence dashboard to help prioritize accounts, and marketing uses the segments for building audiences both on display ads and LinkedIn campaigns.	Website Intent; Segment building; integrations into other systems	Reporting; Logging in without SSO is a huge pain; Contact info isn't the greatest for our industries	I think 6sense is particularly well suited for companies that have a larger team. Most companies I met with at the 6sense conference had large teams of a team of Rev Ops people who specifically worked on 6sense. It's a lot to take on for smaller teams. I would also say people who have shorter sales cycles, the more value you will get.	2025-06-26
	Professional in Marketing (201-500 employees)	We use 6sense to gain valuable sales insights and target high-potential accounts through its advanced keyword search and advertising capabilities. This platform helps us focus our efforts only on accounts that show genuine interest in our products, based on their online behavior and keyword activity. By identifying intent signals early, 6sense eliminates the need to prospect uninterested accounts, saving time and resources. Our primary use of the tool is for both sales insights and targeted advertising, enabling our teams to prioritize accounts more effectively and personalize outreach strategies based on real-time data.	Intent data and keyword searches displayed by account; Advertising segments; Go-to-market alignment	Data enrichment; Account matching; Analytics	6sense is great when used for sales insight, especially in scenarios where sales teams need to prioritize accounts based on buying intent. When we want to identify which accounts are actively researching a product category or specific keywords, 6sense provides visibility into anonymous website visits and intent signals. 6sense can do better in terms data enrichment—such as updating or verifying contact details before import to CRM. While 6sense offers some enrichment features, tools like ZoomInfo is generally more robust to maintaining accurate contact-level data.	2025-06-25
	Consultant in Information Technology (5001-10,000 employees)	IT's being used to manage contact, find leads and convert them into opportunity. We are using it to simplify for sales people to identify, track and convert contacts into leads quickly without losing the progress in real time. It keeps the contact data upto date and being migrated with salesforce it gives us the benefit of updating large number of records very efficiently.	Data Updation; Lead Tracking; Reporting; Migration and Data uploads	UI Interface - Its way too dull and boring; Data load time is so slow that at times it doesnt feel productive at all; Make it more user friendly; Reporting and Dashboard needs to be enhanced by adding multiple functionalities for performing calculations at detailed level	I don't think I will give any scenario where it would fit in. It does help you a bit in contacts updation, lead tracking and similar cases but it's doesn't measure upto salesforce by any means. I would never recommend it to anybody. I don't even see it as a competitor to anyone. It can only add value when it does some serious ehnancement to its tool.	2025-06-24
	Manager in Marketing (501-1000 employees)	6sense has enabled my organization to capture demand through various high intent account segments, and site traffic. As our business goals shifted, we acted quickly to onboard a net new channel that would help enable broader brand capture and drive qualified traffic to our site. 6sense Launching display and native video ads helped contribute to these net new goals, reaching dormant prospects, and new accounts.	Segmentation; Display Ads; Influenced Form Fills	Analytics Tracking; Lower-funnel conversion opportunity; Broader retargeting scopes outside of traffic	6sense is highly useful for verticals in the B2B sphere. I would recommend the platform for organizations that are looking to drive free trials, or demo requests through paid marketing channels. For an organization that is optimizing for purchase events or in e-commerce, I would not recommend 6sense. Unless they are looking to target specific account types (Enterprise, SLED, SMB, etc). The platform is more suitable for organizations that have specific account type goals, more so an ABM focus. The platform has a robust ability to sync specific 1st party data, intent, and behavioral sources to various paid marketing channels (linkedin, meta, etc.). This has shifted the landscape on how we target users across our paid media channels.	2025-06-23
Rev Ops in Marketing	Assent (1001-5000 employees)	We use 6sense in our organization to leverage its predictive modeling to look for new accounts. This helps our reps to target the right accounts and save time. The data taxonomy feature helps us to use AI and give us insights	Data modeling; Predictive insights; Recommend hot accounts	UI is not friendly; Support is a bit slow; Training material is not that great	Well suited: It is ideal for ABM Programs Great at surfacing buyer behavior It is especially useful when we have hundreds and thousands of target accounts and we need to prioritize based on buying and intent signals Not well suited: costy, requires a level of planning and cross functional suipport, if you dont have a target set of accounts	2025-06-18
	Employee in Sales (1001-5000 employees)	6sense keeps me informed around what my accounts are researching specifically related to our value proposition. This allows me to apply targeted messaging and ultimately win more deals. I hope every company I work at utilizes a tool like 6sense, I have won multiple deals because of our partnership - thank you 6sense!	notifying what my accounts are researching; indicating what links prospects are clicking on; sharing competitor research intelligence	Sometimes there are general 6sense notifications that are not the most helpful, more quality would be great; 6sense can be delayed on notifications sometimes, instant notifications when someone clicks on a website link would be cool; more insight into the specific terms being searched by a prospect would help too	6sense is great for a sales rep trying to find prospects that are fits for the product they sell. 6sense will provide alerts to guide you in the right direction. Finance teams will not need this tool as much, but this tool is great for marketing and sales teams that are trying to hit their quotas	2025-06-18
	Employee in Marketing (1001-5000 employees)	To see intent signals based on keywords research and page visits for in crm account or not in crm account We also use it see what people are searching We do contact enrichment	Segment audience that shows intent signals using keywords; Show accounts buying stage; Contact enrichment using sales discovery; Reports showing accounts moved from one stage to another for a segment	Workflows need a lot of work; Contact enrichment for international language; Overall international setup	I like the way it shows intent signals and setup alerts for sales for immediate actions. Workflows didn't work for me as expected however we still use orchestration	2025-06-07
	Manager in Marketing (501-1000 employees)	We use it to identify accounts that have intent to purchase our type of software. We use it to prioritize outreach to accounts by our BDR team. We also use it to create account lists based on SF data, technographic data, etc. We use it to increase the chance of reaching the right people at the right time.	Intent Signaling; Account List Building; Integrations	6sense Display Ads Performance. Hard to track impact and have found we don't perform very well; Contact-Based Lists Instead of just Account-Based Lists; Better matching to Google Ads	I feel like 6sense is great for sales when you have a large sales team, especially a BDR team who is looking for new business consistently and needs help prioritizing. It is less appropriate if you don't have a dedicated ABM marketer with background knowledge of best practices of ABM.	2025-06-05
Business Development Representative in Sales	Sprout Social (501-1000 employees)	I use it everyday to prospect and see which accounts are hot in my book of business. I start my day by looking at the recent activities and then I move on to the hot new and hot accounts.	One of 6sense’s biggest strengths is its ability to uncover anonymous website visitors and match them to accounts within a target list.; 6sense’s AI models classify accounts into buying stages like Awareness, Consideration, Decision, or Purchase-ready.; 6sense integrates smoothly with key platforms like Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, Marketo, and LinkedIn, ensuring that data flows easily between tools and users can take action within their existing workflows.	updates earlier in the morning; more reliable data	It’s highly effective when deciding when to reach out to an account — especially if it surfaces that an account is moving into a higher intent stage (like “Decision” or “Consideration”), signaling it’s a good time to engage. 6sense is excellent for surfacing which ones are actively showing intent signals (like researching keywords, visiting competitors’ sites, or engaging with relevant content). Occasionally, 6sense might flag intent when an account isn’t actually close to being sales-ready — for example, if a prospect is doing research for a long-term initiative. In those cases, intent signals alone shouldn’t dictate engagement strategy without qualification through conversation.	2025-05-08
