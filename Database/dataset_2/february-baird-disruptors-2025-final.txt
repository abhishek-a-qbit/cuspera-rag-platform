Other Disclosures
The information and rating included in this report represent the research analyst’s views based on a time horizon of 12 months, as described above, unless otherwise stated. In some of
our research reports, the subject company may be designated as a “Fresh Pick”, representing that, until the expiration date specified in the report or until the analyst removes such
designation, certain news, events or catalysts could have a near or medium term impact on the market price of the security discussed in that report, which may be directionally opposite
(i.e., bullish/bearish) to the analyst’s published, 12-month rating and/or price target contained in the report. The Fresh Pick designation is not a rating and has no impact on the analyst’s
fundamental rating or price target as defined herein. Baird seeks to keep all our research current, but numerous factors such as rapid changes in market conditions, current events or
regulations can impact our analyst’s ability to do so. Most of our reports are published at irregular intervals, at the sole discretion of the research analyst. The research analyst(s) named in
this report may, at times and at the request of clients or their Baird representatives, provide particular investment perspectives or trading strategies based primarily on the analyst’s
understanding of the individual client’s objectives. These perspectives or trading strategies generally are responsive to client inquiries and based on criteria the research analyst considers
relevant to the client. As such, these perspectives and strategies may differ from the research analyst’s views contained in this report.

Not all clients who receive our standard company-specific research reports are eligible to receive these additional or supplemental products or services. Baird determines in its sole discretion the clients who will receive additional or supplemental products or services, in light of various factors including the size and scope of the client relationships. These additional or supplemental products or services may feature different analytical or research techniques and information than are contained in Baird’s standard research reports. Any ratings and recommendations contained in such additional or research supplemental products are consistent with the research analyst’s ratings and recommendations contained in more broadly disseminated standard research reports.
