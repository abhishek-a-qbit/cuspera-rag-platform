B2B Intent Providers Are Raising The Bar With Rapidly Advancing Capabilities 
The rules of the game have changed dramatically since our previous B2B intent 
Forrester WaveTM, published in 2023. Increased investment combined with rapid 
advancement of technical capabilities have redefined what is considered on par for 
several key evaluation criteria, while new capabilities are driving competition in areas 
that were not even on most roadmaps two years ago. Advances in the LLMs that drive 
generative Al (genAl) have fueled intent capture across over 150 languages and made it 
possible to scale insight capture from unstructured data sources like audio and video 
recordings. Improvements in identity resolution, including advanced device ID graphs, 
are expanding capabilities to parse account-level intent signals by contact persona. Our 
report reflects these market changes as well as feedback from Forrester clients on the 
importance of driving intent adoption to maximize their investments. 
With these advances in mind, B2B intent data customers using this evaluation to inform 
a purchase decision should: 
• Take a fresh look at available data across geographies outside North America. 
Most providers in this evaluation have invested in increasing their intent offering in 
EMEA, APAC, and LATAM. In addition to increased signal capture in English, most 
have introduced the capability to interpret signals across six to 10 key languages, 
with top performers leveraging Al-based translation to understand many times that 
many. While overall capture of non-English intent is still typically less than 20% of 
total signal volume, it has still contributed to significant growth in global data 
capture. 
• Evaluate growing capabilities for persona-level insight. While opted-in contact- level intent is still rare in the market, persona-level analysis and buying group 
prediction are now among the most hotly contested features. These capabilities 
rely on mapping device IDs, hashed emails, and other anonymized persistent 
identifiers to power predictions of the individuals responsible for account-level 
signals. This does not typically include personally identifiable information (PII), but 
top performers can provide insight into the likely size of the potential buying 
group, as well as breakdowns of account-level intent by personas using predicted 
job level and department. 
Focus on providers with a business model built for your needs. Providers listed 
represent four business models with differing strengths. Traditional data providers 
offer third-party signals as a standalone product. Software platforms offer signals 
as part of a platform subscription while competing on their analytics and activation

capabilities. Campaign execution firms generate signals in support of marketing 
services, rolling the cost into activation fees or cost per lead. Walled gardens 
collect signals for specific industries directly from their own users on properties 
like review sites or user communities with pricing similar to traditional data 
providers.

Leaders 
6sense 
6sense is a large platform provider with differentiated analytics and a growing partner 
ecosystem that positions it as a central player in the market. While several competitors 
are rapidly closing the gap, 6sense remains among the most innovative players in the 
2025 Forrester Research, Inc. All trademarks are property of their respective owners.

market. 
• 
Strategy. With an analytics-first strategy, 6sense seeks to set itself apart from most 
intent providers as your centralized source for marketing and sales insights. In 
addition to native keyword intent, a unique bring-your-own-data model easily 
integrates competitor signals into the core 6sense dataset, allowing clients to 
maximize the value of their total intent investment. Other tech platforms and data 
providers prioritize integration with 6sense, providing an ecosystem advantage. 
The intent-specific roadmap is a standout, suggesting continued staying power as 
an innovator. 
• Capabilities. Top identity resolution and noise filtering help power outstanding 
intent reporting and insight generation. A high volume of signals across a wide 
range of keywords make 6sense an option for most industries. Detailed buying 
cycle analysis tailored to each client offering allows precision targeting. A lack of 
persona-based insights beyond captured first-party interactions is a rare below-par 
score. Data capture combines a publisher network with several smaller signal 
sources, including a small walled garden presence. 
• 
Customer feedback. Customers continue to be impressed with the sophistication 
and business value offered across both marketing and sales use cases, though 
they suggest more data transparency behind predictive model scores. Several 
references indicate that new clients should be prepared for a significant learning 
curve in the early stages of implementation. 
Forrester's take. 6sense is a top-performing option for customers looking for 
strong analytics support and a centralized platform for marketing and sales insight 
and activation. 
View 6sense's detailed scorecard. 
TechTarget 
TechTarget (now called Informa TechTarget) is a technology-focused walled garden 
provider with a differentiated offering of contact-level intent. The merger of TechTarget 
and Informa Tech's digital business brings significant new data sources, including the 
publisher and partner ecosystem of NetLine, a promising recent entrant to the intent 
market. 
• Strategy. The combined offerings of the merged company further cement 
TechTarget's leadership position in multilevel intent insights against accounts, 
buying groups, and contacts. Its core strategy revolves around industry-specific

intent signals captured from a diverse collection of owned properties, as well as 
online and in-person event activity. The company has improved the depth of its 
account-level signals, a portion of which continue to be attributed to opted-in 
contacts. A strong roadmap includes work to merge several newly combined 
datasets. 
Capabilities. Proprietary data is the primary differentiator for any walled garden 
provider. TechTarget builds on that strength with exceptional buying group 
identification, expanded geographic coverage, strong buying cycle analysis, and 
in-depth reporting capabilities within the core Priority Engine product. Customers 
can add strong persona-based analysis through an additional purchase of the 
newly acquired Intentive product. A focus on specific industries (primarily 
technology and healthcare) prior to the merger does limit the scope of keyword 
coverage. 
• Customer feedback. Customers tell us that TechTarget has exceptional levels of 
customer support and partnership. TechTarget is a Customer Favorite in this 
evaluation. 
• 
Forrester's take. TechTarget remains the go-to provider for contact-level intent 
insights across the industries it serves and is a compelling choice for those looking 
to expand their intent capabilities globally. 
View TechTarget's detailed scorecard. 
Intentsify 
Intentsify is a campaign execution firm with emerging platform capabilities, offering stiff 
competition to the top players despite entering the market only six years ago. It 
continues to be well positioned to challenge established players in the market. 
• 
Strategy. Intent is at the core of Intentsify's strategy (hence the name), and it 
shows. High-end analytics, bespoke-for-everyone modeling, and a significant 
investment in R&D help drive differentiation. The introduction of the Intentsify Orbit 
identity graph in 2024 ranks among the most significant innovations in the space 
over the past two years, driving persona-based analysis and improved buying 
group prediction. The roadmap of intent-specific features is impressive, though a 
smaller partner ecosystem than other leaders is a primary area for improvement. 
• 
Capabilities. Insight generation and persona-based analysis are standout 
capabilities, making an upcharge for features powered by Intentsify Orbit a 
worthwhile investment for most clients. Like other Leaders competing on analytics, 
Intentsify's accuracy, noise filtering, and identity resolution earned top scores.

Strong growth in geographic coverage is among the company's most significant 
improvements from our previous evaluation. On the other hand, available data 
integrations lag peers. Data collection is primarily bidstream, supplemented by a 
B2B content site co-op, a content-sharing tool, and web crawling. 
• Customer feedback. Customers highlight Intentsify's exceptional level of support 
and their trust in the quality of its data insights. They also point out that Intentsify's 
user interface is not yet at the level of top platform partners. 
• 
Forrester's take. Intentsify is a compelling choice for customers seeking a do-it- 
for-you campaign execution partner with high-end analytics capabilities. 
View Intentsify's detailed scorecard. 
Bombora 
Still the gold standard for account-level intent data feeds, Bombora is a traditional data 
provider that maintains its place among the Leaders on the strength of its exclusive co- 
op of B2B websites. While Bombora data is available inside many competitor platforms, 
this evaluation focuses on the capabilities available when purchasing from Bombora 
directly. 
· 
Strategy. Bombora's partner-focused strategy allows clients to purchase intent 
data through a direct relationship, which includes expanded analytics capabilities, 
or through simple data feeds embedded inside most revenue marketing platforms 
and competitive intent offerings. The company has recently focused on scaling 
available signals, increasing its co-op size by about 20% and topic coverage by 
13% over the past 18 months. 
• Capabilities. Bombora's B2B co-op is made up primarily of sites with exclusive 
relationships, allowing for a highly unique, future-proofed dataset. Broad keyword 
coverage, expanded geographic reach, and strong buying cycle analysis are key 
differentiators. The intent-specific reporting available to direct customers is the 
best in this evaluation, along with its ability to deliver data to suit almost any use 
case. An emphasis on account-level intent results hinders buying group prediction. 
• 
Customer feedback. Multiple customers cite the quality of Bombora's intent data 
as the standard by which they measure their other providers. They point that out 
receiving Bombora data through a partnership does not offer the same features or 
innovation that direct customers receive, and they would like to see a faster 
process for evaluating and adding topics.

· 
Forrester's take. The most recognized name in the intent data market remains a 
trusted source for high-quality account-level signals across almost any use case. 
View Bombora's detailed scorecard. 
Demandbase 
Demandbase is another large platform provider, competing primarily on data, 
orchestration, and automation of go-to-market (GTM) processes. One key element of its 
positioning is transparency, working to help customers understand how predictive 
insights are generated. A tremendous volume of intent signals and well-rounded 
capabilities across the evaluation position them as a top competitor in the space. 
• Strategy. Demandbase focuses on maximizing its platform capabilities for 
orchestration and automation of marketing and sales activity as its primary 
differentiator. An outstanding ecosystem of data and software partners 
complements its orchestration strategy. The company's roadmap for intent 
development is impressive, and its focus on driving customer adoption earned a 
top score. 
Capabilities. Demandbase collects one of the largest signal volumes in the 
evaluation, relying primarily on bidstream to drive extensive keyword coverage. It 
offers highly accurate identity resolution capabilities to match those signals to 
accounts. Exceptional data integration and delivery options support its positioning 
as a full GTM orchestration partner, offering simple connections to most common 
revenue technology. 
• Customer feedback. Customers praise Demandbase for the ease of integration 
into existing processes and technology and the depth of activation functionality. 
They suggest the company could do more to integrate intent insights with other 
key data types they offer. 
• Forrester's take. Demandbase is built for customers seeking a serious marketing and sales execution platform with a depth of intent coverage and strong 
complementary data offerings to support most industries. 
View Demandbase's detailed scorecard. 
ZoomInfo 
ZoomInfo is a major GTM platform player, leveraging its origins as a traditional data 
provider to position its proprietary data offerings as a competitive differentiator across 
its broad suite of software.

• 
· 
Strategy. ZoomInfo's strategy and roadmap are heavily focused on harnessing the 
emerging capabilities of Al for data collection, analysis, and activation. This 
impressive development plan is made possible through the largest R&D investment of any provider in this evaluation. An extensive ecosystem of partners 
is a suitable complement to its strategic advantage as one of the most entrenched 
data providers in B2B. 
⚫ Capabilities. A diverse set of collection methodologies is a standout capability, 
ranging from traditional web activity capture to collection from proprietary 
freemium software offerings and human outreach. While a heavy mix of bidstream 
reduces the overall uniqueness of signal, clients highly value the relatively smaller 
set of signals collected through means that no other provider offers. In recent 
years, ZoomInfo has shown a focus on data compliance and future-proofing 
collection, while identity resolution and data integration are as advanced as you would expect from a top data company. 
• 
Customer feedback. Customers are most complimentary of ZoomInfo's 
comprehensive data offerings and ability to make that data actionable, especially 
for sales. They see room to grow in the company's customer success capabilities, 
noting a too-heavy focus on upsell that reduces the impact of an otherwise 
impressive adoption program. 
Forrester's take. ZoomInfo offers strong intent capabilities across most industries. 
Given the company's data and software footprint, existing customers may overlook 
its intent capabilities, representing untapped potential to take a closer look at what 
they may be missing. 
View ZoomInfo's detailed scorecard. 
Strong Performers 
Madison Logic 
Madison Logic is a campaign execution firm leveraging a significant investment in intent 
data as a differentiated offering for clients. A favorable pricing strategy for data access 
makes the company a competitive option for clients otherwise considering more 
traditional data providers. 
• 
Strategy. Madison Logic's intent strategy focuses on supporting white-glove 
marketing services, but clients investing in campaign execution can also access 
the company's substantial intent data feed for their own internal use at no additional cost. This differentiated pricing strategy is intended to encourage

further campaign investment. The company also presents a robust customer 
adoption program with account-based marketing (ABM) certification that includes 
best practices for leveraging intent signals. 
• Capabilities. Madison Logic is remarkably consistent across its current intent 
offering, demonstrating on-par capabilities nearly throughout. Data integration 
options are above par, particularly when compared with other campaign execution 
peers. It has doubled the size of its available intent dataset over the past two years. It collects a large majority of signals through a network of over 2,000 
partner sites. 
• Customer feedback. Madison Logic receives outstanding feedback for its full- 
service support and ability to make collaborative recommendations to improve 
campaign performance. Customers also appreciate the lack of separate platform 
and data fees. 
• 
Forrester's take. Companies considering a do-it-for-you campaign execution

Data Axle 
Data Axle has a nearly 50-year history as a traditional data provider - the company 
rebranded from its previous name, Infogroup, in 2020. Despite this background, it is 
primarily positioned as a campaign execution firm in the intent market. 
• 
· 
Strategy. Data Axle goes to market as a services company, designing and 
executing largely bespoke ABM and lead generation campaigns on behalf of 
clients. Its extensive partner ecosystem for both data capture and marketing 
activation is a particular strength. Its adoption program is less developed than 
those of its closest peers, in part due to the do-it-for-you nature of the company's 
intent data services. 
Capabilities. Data Axle maintains an individual identity graph, making it a rare data 
provider that plays in both B2B and B2C markets. It successfully leverages this 
database of individuals to supplement its capabilities for buying group prediction. 
This comes at a cost, however, as its most differentiated capabilities are largely 
limited to North America. The company offers strong identity resolution and data 
compliance policies befitting its core business as a major comprehensive data 
provider. An array of collection methodologies across a business co-op, partner 
networks, bidstream, licensed data, and its own campaign exhaust create a

diverse set of signal types. 
• Customer feedback. Customers praise the quality of data available and the 
performance of Data Axle's marketing services but describe its intent reporting as 
more manual than most peers. 
• 
Forrester's take. Data Axle's data and campaign services present an intriguing 
option for companies looking for a more direct means to identify the likely buying group driving account-level intent signals, particularly in North America. 
View Data Axle's detailed scorecard. 
Anteriad 
Anteriad is a full-service marketing execution partner that builds highly customized 
target databases with a privacy-first approach. Intent is one key element within these 
larger datasets, used to help create and activate audiences as part of a broader sales 
and marketing data strategy. 
• 
Strategy. Anteriad has made compliant data collection a strategic focus and 
differentiator, taking more conservative approaches to capturing web browsing 
activity than most peers. Its acquisition of global sales support provider BNZSA in 
2023 has allowed it to supplement more traditional signal capture techniques with 
compliant data through direct human interaction in 26 languages. 
• Capabilities. Data compliance and future-proofed collection methodologies 
received top scores, along with robust capabilities for data integration and delivery 
that are competitive with leading traditional data providers. The offering lacks 
detailed buying cycle or persona-based analysis, and the overall intent dataset 
lacks a high percentage of signals that are likely to be unique. Anteriad launched 
international intent in 2024. While customers took note of the promising data 
quality outside North America, the overall volume of signals collected in other 
regions is not yet on par with peers. 
• 
Customer feedback. Customers describe Anteriad's execution as highly targeted, 
and multiple references praise both its transparency and affordability. The most 
common ask is for improvements to its platform to offer greater data access, 
reporting, and visibility. 
• Forrester's take. Customers looking for highly customized, targeted approaches 
to marketing and sales campaign execution should consider Anteriad, particularly 
those with a highly privacy-conscious corporate culture.

Dun & Bradstreet 
Dun & Bradstreet is a traditional data provider that offers D&B Buyer Intent either as a 
standalone data product or delivered inside one of several software platforms, such as 
Rev.Up ABX and Rev.Up ABX for Sales. 
• 
Strategy. Dun & Bradstreet pursues a comprehensive data provider strategy, with 
intent data offered as a complement to its full suite of company, contact, financial, 
and technographic data products. The breadth and depth of data types that can 
be combined within its tools supports this vision. The lack of clear focus and 
prioritization of intent among this broad product set is reflected in below-par 
scores for innovation and roadmap. 
Capabilities. Dun & Bradstreet offers outstanding data compliance across all its 
data products. On-par capabilities for reporting, insight generation, and data 
integration assume clients are leveraging D&B Buyer Intent inside one of the 
available platform products. The company does not currently offer persona-based 
analysis. It sources intent data through a large partner publisher network, data co- 
ops, and other licensed sources, though the relative breakdown of these signal 
types is unclear, resulting in a below-par score for uniqueness of signals. 
• Customer feedback. Customers praise Dun & Bradstreet for the quality and 
variety of data available, noting its capacity to serve as their primary data provider 
across data types and its ability to blend those data types smoothly inside its 
platforms. Dun & Bradstreet did not provide reference customers for this 
evaluation. 
• 
Forrester's take. Dun & Bradstreet's intent is best positioned as an added value 
for clients with an existing D&B relationship, particularly those using or considering 
the company's CDP offering or one of its execution platforms. 
View Dun & Bradstreet's detailed scorecard. 
RollWorks 
RollWorks is a platform provider offering intent in support of its core capability around 
digital advertising. Competitive pricing and simplicity of purpose are its primary selling 
points. 
• Strategy. RollWorks' strategic vision for intent data is limited to its impact on 
campaign execution and digital ads in particular. A focus on simplicity contributes

to a less detailed future roadmap than peers. The highlight of its strategy is a 
highly competitive pricing model, offering a flat platform fee with no data caps, no 
limits on marketing seats, and five sales insights seats included. The platform fee 
also incorporates Bombora data, with an unusually large number of topics 
included in the base price. 
Capabilities. Aside from the embedded Bombora data, RollWorks' own keyword 
intent dataset is almost entirely bidstream, which offers a reasonable volume but 
lacks a source for significantly unique signals. Buying cycle analysis and buying 
group prediction are on par with the market, though the platform does not offer 
persona-based analysis. Uniqueness of signals, noise filter capabilities, reporting, 
and integration currently lag other platform providers in this evaluation. 
• Customer feedback. Customers repeatedly highlight the ease of use in leveraging 
RollWorks' intent for their advertising. They would like to see continued platform 
development, especially improved reporting and analytics capabilities. 
• Forrester's take. RollWorks offers a simple, effective, and affordable intent data 
option for customers with a need for ad platform capabilities, especially if they 
have the internal analytics skills to take advantage of the available intent feed for 
other use cases.

Contenders 
G2 
G2 is a walled garden provider of software-focused intent generated from its owned 
review sites. Positioned as a complementary provider, G2 partners with most platform 
players to deliver intent inside those products; its most direct competitors are other 
walled garden offerings. 
• Strategy. G2 sees itself evolving into a data company, providing key insights to 
drive demand generation, product positioning, and market intelligence. Al 
experimentation is more focused on ease of use to boost user activity (and signal 
volume) than to change the way intent is collected or activated. Receiving on-par 
strategy scores across the board, its vision, roadmap, and partner strategy are all 
well aligned to its go-to-market strategy as a complementary partner to most other 
providers in this evaluation. 
• 
⚫ Capabilities. The nature of G2's focused industry offering of insights collected 
from software reviews makes it difficult to achieve an on-par score for criteria such

as signal volume, keyword coverage, or collection methodologies. On the flip side, 
its offering achieved top scores for uniqueness of signal and strong data 
integration and delivery options. The lack of persona-based analysis and buying 
group prediction appear to be a conscious decision to offer most content without 
requiring opt-in consent. 
Customer feedback. G2's reference customer, as well as other current customers 
interviewed, leverage G2 as a secondary provider, supplementing their primary 
intent stream. They appreciate G2's ability to offer highly specific insights versus 
its competitors and the availability of later-stage buying signals. G2 provided only 
one reference customer for this evaluation. 
Forrester's take. G2 is well positioned as a value-add intent source for software 
companies and likely already offers an integration to your primary provider. 
View G2's detailed scorecard. 
DemandScience 
DemandScience is a campaign execution firm that recently announced a merger with 
Terminus, an ABM platform provider. The combined offering will blend 
DemandScience's proprietary intent data offering with expanded platform execution 
capabilities. 
· 
• 
Strategy. DemandScience historically placed less emphasis on platform 
investment than peers, focusing instead on a strategy of highly customized, 
customer-specific intent to drive campaigns. That vision has now changed to 
include stronger platform capabilities and a larger, integrated dataset. This 
strategy earned on-par scores for vision and roadmap but lacks a clear path for innovation in the near term. The current partner ecosystem and adoption 
programs lag campaign execution peers. A recent decision to simplify outcome- 
based pricing and eliminate the platform fee is an intriguing change of pace for a 
company that will be competing as a platform player. 
Capabilities. DemandScience's previous platform is less developed than most 
peers due to its focus on do-it-for-you demand generation services. Lagging 
scores across several related criteria such as reporting, data integration, and 
buying cycle analysis may be addressed by its coming roadmap. The company 
currently offers persona-based analysis. Intent signals are primarily bidstream, 
supported by publisher co-op data. The size and uniqueness of this dataset still 
lags peers, but the combined intent feed will warrant reevaluation.

• 
Customer feedback. Customers appreciate DemandScience's customer service 
approach and describe the company as an affordable option that produces solid 
ROI. 
• Forrester's take. While the potential of the combined company is yet to be seen, 
DemandScience is currently a competitively priced option for companies seeking 
strong return from an intent-based revenue marketing partner.

TrustRadius 
TrustRadius is a walled garden provider of intent gathered from its own software review 
site. TrustRadius focuses on a familiar strategy among tech-focused walled gardens, 
providing a hard-to-find set of complementary signals as your secondary or tertiary 
provider. 
· 
• 
• 
Strategy. TrustRadius focuses its strategic efforts on driving traffic to its review 
pages, branding itself as the most trusted software review site in the market. This 
creates strategic hesitation around data collection techniques that may feel 
intrusive to users, though its lack of focus on innovation is at odds with a 
significant contribution from intent products to the company's revenue. While its 
intent-specific strategy is not highly differentiated from peers, it does offer a well- 
developed partner ecosystem and solid adoption support. 
Capabilities. TrustRadius offers a no-frills intent product focused on delivering 
detailed activity data at the account level to clients. A highly unique signal set and 
future-proofed collection techniques earned high scores, though criteria focused 
on signal volume, coverage, and analytics capabilities are below par. 
Customer feedback. Customers value TrustRadius' exclusive signals and intel on 
competitive evaluation and note its strong customer service. Most do not consider 
TrustRadius to be a direct competitor to their primary intent providers. TrustRadius 
did not provide reference customers for this evaluation. 
Forrester's take. TrustRadius provides valuable insights for software companies 
that can afford to invest in multiple sources of intent signals, particularly for those 
considered with comparison shopping behaviors among their prospects or 
existing customers.

Spiceworks Ziff Davis 
Spiceworks Ziff Davis (SWZD) operates in a hybrid model: part campaign execution firm 
and part walled garden. The company captures exclusive signals from a variety of 
owned properties, though most signals come from more traditional sources. 
• Strategy. SWZD has an interesting strategic approach to intent, combined with a 
logical roadmap, but a lack of prioritization and investment to date has kept the 
offering from fully realizing its potential. The company received below-par scores 
for partner ecosystem, adoption, and a somewhat opaque pricing strategy. SWZD 
brings a promising story into the Wave evaluation, but execution against that 
strategy to date has been incomplete. 
• 
⚫ Capabilities. The most impactful element of the company's current offering is the 
diversity of the collection methodologies it employs. The bulk of the data comes 
from the bidstream, but proprietary signals are captured from an impressive range 
of owned properties, including the Spiceworks Community, Spiceworks News and 
Insights, Spiceworks Cloud Help Desk, PCMag, and Mashable. The dataset now 
includes a significant volume of data from recently acquired CNET properties, 
though this work was not completed in time to be reflected in data coverage 
scores. With other planned product enhancements not yet complete, however, 
scores still lagged across multiple categories related to analytics and reporting, 
data compliance, and integrations. 
Customer feedback. Customer references point out that while SWZD still has work 
to do to fully productize its offering, the insights available are impressive, and the 
service and support are strong. Only one of SWZD's reference customers 
responded to Forrester's outreach for this evaluation. 
• Forrester's take. SWZD offers an enticing mix of intent signal types that will be 
valuable to tech-focused clients with the internal marketing and analytics 
capabilities to fully act on them.

• Strategy. Placement on the horizontal axis indicates the strength of the providers' 
strategies, including elements such as vision and innovation. 
• 
Customer feedback. A halo on a provider's marker indicates above-average 
customer feedback relative to the other evaluated providers. A double halo 
indicates outstanding customer feedback: We consider the provider to be a 
Customer Favorite. As part of this evaluation, we speak with up to three customers 
of each provider. We also consider customer input from our previous research. 
Vendor Inclusion Criteria 
Each of the providers we included in this assessment has: 
• Second- or third-party proprietary intent data. Providers must demonstrate their 
own proprietary means of collecting either second- or third-party intent signals that 
are made available to all intent clients. This does not include signals captured on 
behalf of clients for their exclusive use. Forrester did not include pure data 
aggregators or resellers that don't also offer their own proprietary data. We gave 
preference for inclusion toward providers that add a significant volume of 
proprietary intent signals to the market. 
• 
Substantial intent data revenue. The provider has at least $10 million in annual 
revenue from customers leveraging its intent data offerings in the past four 
quarters. 
• Mindshare among Forrester's enterprise clients. Forrester clients frequently 
mention the offering as one they are considering or shortlisting prior to a 
purchase. We have heard about the provider's intent offering from our clients in 
the form of inquiries, advisories, consulting engagements, and other interactions 
over the past 12 months. Other providers frequently mention this provider as a 
competitor in the market. 
Other Notable Vendors 
The Forrester Wave evaluation is an assessment of the top providers in the market; it 
doesn't represent the entire vendor landscape. You'll find more information about this 
market and additional providers that Forrester considers to be notable for enterprise 
clients in our corresponding report: The Intent Data Providers For B2B Landscape, Q3 
2024. 
B2B intent data customers may be familiar with or considering the following providers, 
which appeared in our 2023 Wave, but which we did not evaluate in this report:

• 
Foundry. The intent product we evaluated in 2023 is no longer generally available 
for sale; it's now offered exclusively as a benefit to members of Foundry's partner 
network. 
• PharosIQ (formerly MRP). MRP announced a merger with CONTENTgine in 2024, 
repositioning the combined organization as pharosIQ, a broader marketing 
services firm that does not position itself to compete as a full-service intent data 
provider. 
Supplemental Material 
The Forrester Wave Methodology 
A Forrester Wave is a guide for buyers considering their purchasing options in a 
technology marketplace. To offer an equitable process for all participants, Forrester 
follows The Forrester WaveTM Methodology to evaluate participating vendors. 
In our review, we conduct primary research to develop a list of vendors to consider for 
the evaluation. From that initial pool of vendors, we narrow our final list based on the 
inclusion criteria. We then gather details of product and strategy through a detailed 
questionnaire, demos and briefings, and interviews with customers (vendors may 
provide up to three reference customers; we also consider feedback from other 
customers we've spoken with). We use those inputs, along with the analyst's 
experience and expertise in the marketplace, to score vendors, using a relative rating 
system that compares each vendor against the others in the evaluation. 
We include the publishing date (quarter and year) clearly in the title of each Forrester 
Wave report. We evaluated the vendors participating in this Forrester Wave using 
materials they provided to us by December 6, 2024 and did not allow additional 
information after that point. We encourage readers to evaluate how the market and 
vendor offerings change over time. 
In accordance with our vendor review policy, Forrester asks vendors to review our 
findings prior to publishing to check for accuracy. We score vendors that met our 
defined inclusion criteria but declined to participate in or contributed only partially to 
the evaluation in accordance with our vendor participation policy and publish their 
positioning along with those of the participating vendors. 
Dun & Bradstreet and TrustRadius declined to participate in the full Forrester Wave 
evaluation process. For vendors that are not full participants, Forrester uses primary 
and secondary research in its analysis. For example, we might use public information, 
data gathered via briefings, and independently sourced customer interviews to score
