Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer's Guide 
Scope and methodology 
This report examines the marketing automation platforms (MAPs) market and considerations for  choosing and implementing marketing automation software. It addresses the following questions: 
• What factors are driving the use of MAPs? 
• What core capabilities do MAPs provide, and how are artificial intelligence and machine learning enhancing the traditional features of MAPs? 
• Does my company need a MAP? 
• Who are the leading players in marketing automation? 
• How do I evaluate which platform is best for my business? 
If you are considering licensing a MAP, this report will help you decide whether it's worth investing  in one. The report was completely updated to include the latest industry statistics, developing  market trends, new vendor profiles and product updates.  
In this report, a MAP is defined as software to execute, manage and automate repetitive  marketing tasks and processes - with the assistance of AI and machine learning - to engage  customers and prospects more effectively through multiple channels (i.e., email, mobile, social  media and websites). Marketing automation involves the creation, scheduling, targeting and  tracking of marketing campaigns, allowing marketing and sales organizations to nurture leads  with highly personalized content aimed at attracting and retaining customers. 
The vendors profiled in this report represent only some of the providers of these technologies -  this is not a comprehensive list. This report is not a recommendation of any platform or company  and is not meant to endorse any product, service or vendor. 
This report was prepared by asking in-depth questions of leading vendors, MAP users and  industry experts in the fourth quarter of 2024. These efforts, in addition to third-party research,  form the basis of this report.

Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer's Guide 
Marketing automation overview 
The marketing automation platform (MAP) is the backbone of many modern marketing  technology stacks. It plays a crucial role in the business strategies of both B2B and B2C  companies, especially those offering high-consideration purchases or operating in the ecommerce  space.  
Initially solely B2B-focused and combining email automation with lead-capturing landing pages  and forms, MAPs have expanded their capabilities to encompass a wide range of marketing  functions, enabling more sophisticated lead management and scoring as well as content  personalization at scale. In addition, these platforms now extend their reach across multiple  marketing channels and many leverage AI to enhance creative and analytical functions. 
The global marketing automation software market is expected to grow from $5.7 billion in 2023  to $15.2 billion by 2033, representing a compound annual growth rate of 10.3%, according to  Market.us (see Figure 1).

MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: 
Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer's Guide 
The personalization imperative 
Personalization has become a key driver of the demand for MAPs. Consumers and business  buyers, conditioned by digital trendsetters, expect tailored online experiences based on data  they've shared with the company.  
Seventy-one percent of consumers expect companies to deliver personalized interactions, and  76% get frustrated without them, according to a McKinsey report. 
Businesses that meet those heightened expectations build customer loyalty and greater LTV.  More than three-quarters of consumers (76%) said receiving personalized communications was a  key factor in considering a brand, and 78% said content tailored to them made them more likely to  repurchase.  
"Rather than putting consumers in predefined - and often outdated - boxes, companies should  focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences," advises  McKinsey in its State of the Consumer 2024 report. 
Marketing automation platforms, especially those with advanced AI and ML features, help  marketers deliver real-time, personalized, omnichannel experiences utilizing advanced audience  segmentation. 
I think the challenge most marketers face is how do we get the most  
out of our tools? How can we get them to 'talk' to each other better,  
leveraging collective data and insights to gain efficiencies and, ultimately,  more conversions? How do we wow our customers with personalized  
content and experiences?" 
Karissa Sachs, VP of Marketing, Cella by Randstad Digital 
Marketing automation platforms for ABM 
In the B2B arena, where marketing automation originally established itself as a key technology,  marketers are increasingly adopting account-based marketing (ABM) practices. Forty to 60% of  programs currently leverage marketing automation platforms to further these strategies, a survey  conducted by Momentum ITSMA and the ABM Leadership Alliance found.  
ABM targets buying groups rather than individuals, recognizing that multiple people in a company  - each with their own viewpoint and responsibility - typically decide on big purchases together  (see Figure 2).

While vendors in the marketing automation category have long utilized machine learning to  score leads, the boom in AI and ML, along with an increased marketer appetite for AI-driven  functionality, is driving additional innovation among vendors. Currently, 44% of marketers are  using AI to engage with their audiences while another 29% plan to do so, according to Ascend2's  Customer Engagement & AI study (see Figure 3).

Marketing automation vendors frequently use AI to identify valuable audience segments and then  deliver dynamically personalized content to those audiences. This ability to better understand  customers and anticipate their needs is "significantly improved" (33%) or "somewhat improved"  (68%) by AI, the same Ascend2 study reveals (see Figure 4).

Generative AI applications, such as generating text, images, video or other content, are also  gaining a place in MAPs. These platforms assist marketers in quickly creating content for email  campaigns, landing pages and other touchpoints.  
Tools like these increase a marketer's ability to efficiently create many versions of messages,  with each version tailored to the interests and needs of a particular segment. AI is now helping  to reduce the time and resources needed to create multiple versions of content for segmented  audiences.

The replacement wave 
MAPs remain the most frequently replaced martech application for the fifth straight year, with  31% of respondents replacing their MAP in 2024, according to the MarTech Replacement Survey,  2024 (see Figure 5). This suggests ongoing dissatisfaction or a lack of differentiation among  available solutions.

Interestingly, cost has become the dominant factor when choosing replacement martech,  including MAPs. In 2024, 61% of respondents cited cost as an important factor, up significantly  from 37% in 2023. However, most martech stacks continue to grow despite budget pressure, with  57% of respondents reporting their stack grew by one to five applications in the past year.

MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: 
Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer's Guide 
The need for differentiation 
The high replacement rate for MAPs suggests that the category has become somewhat  commoditized, according to the MarTech Replacement Survey, with vendors failing to innovate  and differentiate themselves. Additionally, marketing automation platforms face the challenge  of distinguishing themselves from other kinds of tools, given that they share functionality with  email marketing platforms, multi-channel marketing hubs, ABM platforms, journey orchestration  platforms and even CDPs. 
Our research suggests that vendors are emerging from complacency and meeting these  challenges, in part due to the capabilities that emerging AI and machine learning technologies are  bringing to MAPs.  
The utilization challenge 
In addition to developing these new capabilities, MAP vendors also grapple with encouraging  users to take advantage of functionality beyond the uses to which they've grown accustomed.  This challenge plagues vendors across the martech spectrum, and it's especially important at a  
time when marketers are under increased pressure to demonstrate the ROI of their technology  investments. 
...Many companies use only a small subset of the features of their chosen  platform, yet vendors are continuing to build in complexity with more and  more capabilities. It seems like the HubSpot model of 'one package for  
everything marketing-related' is likely to be the end result for many of the  current MAP vendors today."  
- Mike Maynard, CEO of B2B marketing agency Naylor 
Big mergers are done;  
integration continues 
The marketing automation market is dominated by a few cloud vendors, including Salesforce,  Oracle and Adobe. These players typically entered the market via acquisitions (of ExactTarget,  Eloqua and Marketo, respectively) and have successfully integrated them into their product suites.  
In other cases, we've seen companies in other categories - such as CRM or email marketing -  expand to become full-featured marketing automation solutions. Though marketing automation  was primarily B2B-oriented initially, more recently, ecommerce companies and smaller businesses  have begun exploring the benefits of these solutions. In response, a fairly new group of players,  including Klaviyo and Brevo, have emerged with a focus on supporting ecommerce marketers.  
Our research  
suggests that  vendors are  
emerging from  complacency and  meeting these  challenges, in  part due to the  capabilities that  emerging AI and  machine learning  technologies are  bringing to MAPs.

Capabilities and  
differentiating factors 
As basic functions of marketing automation become somewhat commoditized, platform vendors  try to differentiate on the ability to scale (especially over new marketing channels), usability, ease  of implementation, customer experience features and the integration of artificial intelligence and  machine learning capabilities.  
Vendors continue to expand training programs, as well as add-on professional services, to improve  platform use. Online communities - for both customers and developers - are also increasingly  important in strengthening platform support, advocacy and market penetration. 
Many MAP vendors have roots in email marketing, which continues to be a core function. It's  sometimes the only function customers use. Now, MAPs typically deliver messages to mobile devices  (via SMS, MMS and chat), and include advanced lead management, ABM tools and predictive analytics.  
Though the space has long been oriented toward B2B marketing, providers increasingly offer  functionality tailored to B2C use cases, especially for ecommerce and high-consideration  purchases, with some vendors specializing in working with this type of client.  
Whatever their uses, today's MAPs offer open architectures that make it easier to integrate  with the other parts of a martech stack. Notably, these integrations can include tighter ties with  chatbots and webinars. (See Table 1 for vendor capability comparisons.) 
Capabilities 
Every solution in this report comes with tools for email campaign development and execution  (including landing pages), as well as lead capture, scoring and nurturing. They also typically provide  centralized marketing databases and a basic level of reporting on web traffic, visitor behavior and  campaign results. Additionally, native CRM integrations are included, as are app marketplaces or  APIs to enable faster connections with other technologies.  
The market is quickly evolving, as marketers demand integrated marketing functionality and  MAP vendors expand to B2C and D2C use cases. Vendors continue to add features for building,  tracking and managing campaigns across additional channels and/or devices, and monitoring the  flow of leads as they move from marketing to sales. Many vendors see marketing automation as  just one element of a larger platform focused on customer engagement. 
These more advanced features include, but are not limited to:  
• AI-powered dynamic content generation (email, SMS, landing pages and/or website); • Email deliverability tools; 
• Account-based marketing (ABM) features; 
• Mobile marketing, including SMS; 
• AI-based predictive analytics; and 
• Social/lead profile integration. 
The following section discusses these core and advanced marketing automation capabilities in  more depth. 
Whatever their  uses, today's  
MAPs offer open  architectures that  make it easier to  integrate with the  other parts of a  martech stack.

Dynamic content creation and delivery, sometimes powered by AI  
Virtually all MAPs let users create, send and measure personalized email campaigns. Where they  differ is in how email, landing page and website content are created and personalized. Some offer  wizard-based campaign design or content templates, while others provide a more customized  
approach. More recently, vendors have begun to offer generative AI capabilities for content  
creation, building in tools that create text and images for their messaging - typically through  
integrations with providers like OpenAI or others.  
There are also differences in static vs. dynamically generated content, which adjusts content  
on-the-fly as prospects interact with a website or form. Progressive profiling is often offered to  
pre-populate forms with known data and to capture additional prospect information each time  
individuals interact with campaigns.

Email and landing page previewing have become more important as marketers seek to reach  
their audience through mobile devices and to see what their message will look like on a variety of  
different screens. 
Lead management, possibly augmented by AI 
Lead management comprises three functions: lead capture, lead scoring and lead nurturing.  
Leads are captured from the various sources feeding the marketing automation database.  These include but are not limited to website visitors, social media, paid digital campaigns, email  marketing respondents, trade show attendees and purchased third-party lists. The ease with  which additional lead sources are captured, such as through an open API, and whether the  platform offers landing page optimization, will differ among platforms. 
Lead nurturing is the process of keeping prospects engaged through periodic, personalized  communications or campaigns until they are ready to buy. MAPs may offer pre-built nurturing steps or  actions, as well as allow users to customize their content. When done right, customization can build a  relationship between the brand and its prospects, and drive interaction with sales when the prospect  is ready. This capability is also augmented with artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies,  which can analyze vast amounts of data to suggest the next best action for engaging a lead.  
Lead scoring assigns a value to each lead based on a predetermined set of rules or criteria. Traditional lead  scoring models are generally based on two sets of data values: behavior (i.e., site purchases, browsing,  social posts) and demographics/firmographics. Many MAPs now offer predictive scoring driven by AI and  machine learning, which can incorporate hundreds of data points by sourcing websites, social networks  and internal systems - such as the CRM and marketing database itself - to calculate scores. 
Predictive analytics driven by AI and ML 
Virtually all the MAPs in this report provide a standard set of analytics that track quantifiable  data such as website visitor activity, pages viewed, time spent on site, emails opened, content  downloaded and campaign responses. More vendors are offering predictive analytics and models  
Lead nurturing  is the process of  keeping prospects  engaged

based on machine learning. This uses algorithms to process data and surface trends or insights  
that enable marketers to customize visitor experiences and marketing campaigns. 
Several platforms have invested in AI that goes a step beyond machine learning. This uses  technology to mimic human intelligence and recommend marketing actions or outcomes. These  may include highly personalized website content or product recommendations based on analyses  of consumption trends, on-site behavior, firmographics and CRM data. Other vendors rely on plug and-play integration with predictive analytics tools to offer greater analytics and personalization. 
Mobile marketing  
Creating an engaging experience for mobile prospects and customers is a must-have capability. As  a result, many MAPs include responsive templates for email, landing pages and web forms. Several  vendors integrate with email testing tools such as Litmus, which allows users to preview email  messages across clients and devices. 
Other mobile marketing features include SMS/texting, in-app marketing and remote platform  management from mobile devices. In-app marketing features can include push notifications or  ads based on geography (i.e., geofencing or beaconing) or during events. Marketing automation  vendors have also expanded platform access to mobile users, moving beyond automated alerts  and remote data collection to full platform management. 
Email deliverability 
Message deliverability is also an important factor to consider. Some marketing automation  vendors offer dedicated IP addresses to monitor and improve deliverability, either through their  own services or through partners.  
Creating an  
engaging  
experience for  mobile prospects  and customers  is a must-have  capability.

Account-based marketing  
Aligning marketing initiatives with sales teams is a top ABM priority for marketers. The goal of ABM  
is to target marketing programs to prospect or customer buying teams, rather than to individuals.  The larger the purchase, the more people and departments are involved. MAP vendors continue  to add new ABM features to enable marketers to address the buying group in addition to individual  members through enhanced account nurturing and predictive scoring capabilities.  
Social/lead profile integration  
Most of the MAPs in this report provide some level of social media publishing, sharing and  tracking for networks such as Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter) and LinkedIn.  Some provide more advanced tools to monitor social posts and add social behavior to lead  profiles, often using social engagement as a scoring factor. Other platforms enable the use of  social media sign-on to capture social profile data and build lead profiles.  
Native CRM and CDP integration 
With more businesses seeking to align marketing with sales, native or out-of-the-box integration  with CRM systems has become a critical feature for MAPs. Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics 365,  Oracle NetSuite and SugarCRM are among the most commonly available connectors. 
Data is synchronized between the two systems and shared in both directions at frequent  intervals. For example, data that is added by a sales rep to an account record in the CRM will be  automatically added to the record in the MAP so marketers can use it too.  
Integrations with CDPs serve similar purposes and are growing in importance as marketers seek  the more sophisticated functionality that such platforms can provide. 
With more  
businesses seeking  to align marketing  with sales, native  or out-of-the-box  integration with  CRM systems has  become a critical  feature for MAPs.

Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer's Guide 
Third-party software connectivity  
Vendors develop APIs and foster relationships with external developers via app marketplaces as a  way for customers to access an expansive array of third-party software systems. App marketplaces  provide faster plug-and-play access between the systems, although there may be additional fees. 
If a preferred app is not available on a vendor's marketplace it doesn't mean the two systems won't  connect - just that some customization will be required. API use may incur additional charges,  generally on a per-call basis for each data download. 
App marketplaces can be an important area of differentiation for vendors. Cultivating  relationships with developers who create add-ons and integration tools adds to the software's  utility without requiring the vendor to develop those integrations. If you're considering licensing a  MAP, be sure to assess potential partners' efforts in this arena. 
AI and machine learning 
Users will experience the influence of AI's development throughout advanced MAPs, where it's  being used to improve the performance of traditional functions, as described above. However,  some platforms may offer users or administrators the option to customize the data "ingredients"  used to build AI models or the weights given to the various inputs. Others may be more of a  "black box," where users don't necessarily know how the AI arrived at a certain conclusion or  recommendation.

Choosing a marketing  
automation platform 
The benefits of marketing automation  
The proliferation of channels and devices makes it difficult to target prospects with the right  messages, on the right devices, at the right times.  
In the B2B arena, prospects are managing more of the buying process themselves, researching  brand websites and social channels without ever speaking to a sales rep. To thrive in this  environment, B2B marketers must be creative, targeted and aligned with sales goals; they must  also have visibility into buyer attributes and behaviors. 
These dynamics and increased ROI pressure make the benefits of a MAP more attractive than ever: 
• Increased marketing efficiency. Automating time-consuming, manual tasks around content  creation, management and personalization; campaign scheduling and execution; data hygiene  (i.e. duplicate or inconsistent data residing in various silos); communication with sales; and lead  nurturing. AI and machine learning will drive even more efficiency as these tools become more  sophisticated and eliminate repetitive tasks, including generating personalized content for  segments and individuals.  
• Enhanced ability to generate more and better-qualified leads. Marketing automation can  combine multiple criteria, including demographic, firmographic and behavioral data with a  lead-scoring system to generate and identify sales-qualified leads. The addition of AI and  machine learning makes this process even more effective, as the tools can bring together a  large amount of data and pick up on patterns missed by humans. 
• A multichannel view of prospect behavior. Today's MAPs integrate multiple channels and  devices - including social media and mobile - to create more comprehensive prospect profiles  and holistic views of prospect behavior. Platforms with strong ABM capabilities let marketers  see the behavior of a buying group, as well as learn the interests of each individual in it.  
• Better alignment of sales and marketing goals. MAPs can help align sales and marketing  efforts to ensure that sales reps are working with sales-ready leads. By jointly setting scoring  parameters and defining qualified leads, sales and marketing work better together. Marketing  focuses on building relationships with early-stage leads, which lets sales work on closing the  most highly qualified prospects.  
• Improved lead conversion and ROI. Numerous studies have found that using a marketing  automation system can increase conversions. Forrester found that B2B marketers who  implement marketing automation have a 10% increase in their sales-pipeline contribution.  It can also result in a 15% increase in sales productivity and a 12% decrease in marketing  overhead, according to tech research firm Nucleus Research.  
In the B2B arena,  prospects are  
managing more of  the buying process  themselves,  
researching brand  websites and  
social channels  without ever  
speaking to a sales  rep.

MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: 
Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer's Guide 
MAP pricing  
Virtually all MAPs offer SaaS-based pricing, meaning software is licensed by the customer and  hosted and maintained by the vendor. Some vendors targeting the enterprise market also offer  on-site installation and implementation services. 
Pricing is often based on the number of contacts in the marketing database, the number of  marketing messages sent each month and/or the number of users. Many vendors require annual  contracts (although some offer month-to-month pricing) and may offer discounts in exchange for  longer-term commitments. 
Many vendors don't disclose specific pricing but it can range from $350 per year for a "lite"  plan at a provider focused on small businesses to $180,000 annually or more for a full-featured  subscription from an enterprise vendor. 
Recommended steps to making  an informed purchase  
When you're considering adopting or replacing a MAP, it's important to understand your current  marketing processes, decide on how to measure success and identify where you're looking for  improvements.  
The following section outlines four steps to help your organization begin that process.  Step one: Do you need a marketing automation platform?  
Deciding whether your company needs a MAP requires the same evaluative steps involved in  any software adoption. These include a comprehensive self-assessment of your organization's  business needs, staff capabilities, management support and financial resources. 
Use the following questions as a guideline to determine your organization's needs. 
• Have we outgrown our current marketing system? Marketing automation is often a solution for  rapidly growing companies that need to scale their efforts. If you have data in multiple databases  that cannot be consolidated, or are using an email system that can't deliver the level of behavioral  targeting you need, it may be time for marketing automation. Consider, also, how much time your  staff is spending on repetitive tasks that could be sped up or eliminated by a MAP.  
• What marketing automation capabilities are most critical to our business? Identify and  prioritize your software requirements and the key capabilities you'll need. Do your sales  reps need real-time access to marketing data? If so, native CRM integration is a must-have.  Do you have a sophisticated social media presence? Then social marketing management and  integration will be important. Knowing all this puts you in a better position to control the  selection process and choose the best platform for your organization.  
• What kind of MAP do we need? Marketing automation is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Nearly  all vendors offer the same basic capabilities for email, website tracking and a marketing database.  Additional capabilities vary, however, so it's important to identify your business's needs. Is inbound  marketing (social media, blogging, SEO) more important than outbound (email, SMS)? Are reporting  and analytics the key features for you? Is lead scoring a crucial part of your marketing program? Do  you need greater capabilities in audience segmentation and personalization? 
Virtually all  
MAPs offer SaaS based pricing,  meaning software  is licensed by  
the customer  
and hosted and  maintained by the  vendor. 
(c) 2025 Third Door Media(r), a Semrush company 18 https://martech.org 
MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: 
Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer's Guide 
• What are our goals? It is critical to know your goals for the MAP. Do you want to improve the  quality of leads handed off by marketing to sales? Or grow revenue by increasing conversion at  key stages in the buying cycle? Do you want to improve visibility into the buying and sales cycles  to optimize marketing engagement? Do you wish to reach the growing portion of your leads that  are mobile users? Bring key stakeholders together to establish the organization's goals. 
• How will it integrate with our existing tech stack? Identify all the tools you already have so  you can ask the MAP vendor about integrations. Many vendors offer app marketplaces, which  provide faster access to the participating systems. Virtually all marketing automation vendors  offer APIs, but they may be an add-on to the price of the platform and you'll also need to  employ developers to make the necessary connections. 
• Does management support this purchase? Every marketer should have an executive sponsor  to secure support at the C-level. If you are not the ultimate decision maker for this purchase,  you will need management to buy into the idea before going any further. Present a compelling  case that the benefits of new software vastly outweigh the costs. These benefits could include  converting more leads, making sales more efficient and improving campaign ROI. 
• Do we have the internal skill sets and staff we need? To maximize your ROI, staff will need  training and a willingness to develop and execute new business processes. You may also need  to consider several new hires. If your marketing and sales organizations have been operating  in silos, they will need to work more cooperatively on lead scoring and routing systems,  lead qualification definitions and more effective marketing collateral and communications.  Identify someone who will be using the system once it has been adopted to take the lead in the  selection process. 
• How will we measure success? This is one of the toughest questions and ties in directly to  understanding why you are adopting a MAP. If your goal is to increase conversions, you'll  need to know what your conversion rate is before automation to measure its impact. If it's to  improve email efficiency, be prepared with metrics on open rates, clicks, etc. In addition to  measuring against your marketing goals, it's wise to measure the depth and breadth of platform  usage. Many marketers only use basic email capabilities within their marketing automation  platform, meaning they're paying for features that aren't being utilized.  
• Do we know the full cost? Some MAPs are all-inclusive, while others feature add-on tools and  services that can significantly increase costs. In addition to the cost of the software license itself,  consider the costs of ongoing services and training, as well as the indirect costs associated with  getting staff up and running on the new system (i.e., more cooperation and data sharing between  marketing and sales). If you don't have your own IT or design staff, be sure to ask questions about  what these services cost on an hourly basis. For example, if the platform offers templates, find  out how many, and how much it costs to customize template design.  
Step two: Identify and contact appropriate vendors  
Once you have determined that marketing automation software makes sense, research individual  vendors and their capabilities.  
• Make a list of all the marketing automation capabilities you currently have (i.e., email  campaign sending), those you would like to have (i.e., predictive scoring or recommendations)  and those you can't live without (i.e., plug-and-play CRM integration). This last category is  critical and could help you avoid a costly mistake. 
• Research vendors using that list to see which ones can meet your needs. Then send them the  list of what you need and set a timeframe for them to reply. 
To maximize  
your ROI, staff  will need training  and a willingness  to develop  
and execute  
new business  processes. 
(c) 2025 Third Door Media(r), a Semrush company 19 https://martech.org 
MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: 
Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer's Guide 
• Decide whether you need to engage in a formal RFI/RFP process. This is an individual  preference but be sure to give the same list of capabilities to each vendor to facilitate  comparison. 
The most effective RFPs only request relevant information from the vendors and provide ample  information about your business and its needs. Let the vendor know how you plan to use marketing  automation, including your high-level strategic goals and KPIs and how you will measure success.  Include details about timelines and existing digital technology you have deployed. 
When written properly, an RFP will facilitate the sales process and ensure both sides come to  a shared understanding of the purpose, requirements, scope and structure of the intended  purchase. From the RFP responses, you should be able to narrow your list down to three or four  platforms to demo.  
Step three: Scheduling the demo  
Set up demos soon after receiving the RFP responses. Make sure that all potential internal users  are on the demo call or at the in-person meeting, and pay attention to the following: 
• How easy is the platform to use? 
• Does the vendor understand our business and our marketing needs? 
• Are they showing us our "must-have" features? 
• If we ask a specific question, can they demonstrate the answer on the call? Other questions to ask each vendor include:  
• How easy is it to integrate this software into my organization? 
• What is the onboarding process? 
• How long does implementation take? 
• What kind of support and training are included in the base price? 
• What does your partner and developer community look like? 
• How can I maximize adoption in my organization? 
• Will we have a dedicated account rep available to us? 
• Do current customers utilize the full functionality? 
• What new features are you focusing on for the coming year? 
• Can we do a test run for a few days on our own (i.e., a free trial)? 
• How do you protect and secure customer data? What would you do in the event of a hack or  denial-of-service attack? 
Don't hesitate to ask for a demonstration of the specific capabilities that you have identified in  your RFI/RFP. Consider requesting product demos showing basic tasks and demonstrating core  reports such as: 
• Create and edit a new email from scratch. 
• Import and segment data, using any AI or machine-learning capabilities available. • Database management, cleansing and enrichment options. 
• Create and edit a new landing page from scratch. 
• Execute a simple campaign with an email, mailing list and landing page. 
• See a report showing email opens, clickthroughs and landing page conversions. • See a report showing web traffic and/or specific leads from an email campaign. • ROI dashboards and reports at the organization and campaign levels. 
• Campaign attribution options and capabilities. 
This is an ongoing relationship - it's important to feel that your questions are being answered.  
The most  
effective RFPs  only request  
relevant  
information from  the vendors and  provide ample  information about  your business and  its needs.

MARTECH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: 
Marketing Automation Platforms: A Marketer's Guide 
Step four: Check references, negotiate a contract  
Before deciding on a vendor, check out its online community and review sites, and speak with  one or two customer references, preferably someone in a business like yours. The vendor should  be able to supply you with references, but you should also ask around in professional discussion  forums or at industry conferences (in-person or virtual) and networking events.  
Use this opportunity to ask any additional questions, and to find out more about questions  that weren't answered during the demo. Make sure that the person you've been referred to is a  primary user of the platform. Ask the people working with this vendor these basic questions: 
• Why did you license a marketing automation platform? 
• Did you migrate to this platform from another? If so, how was the conversion process? • Why did you select this platform over others? 
• How long did the system take to implement? 
• Has this platform lived up to your expectations? 
• Did you receive the level of support you needed? 
• What CRM system or CDP is this platform integrated with? Are you pleased with that  integration? 
• Were there any surprises that you wish you'd known about beforehand? • Where have you seen the most success? The biggest challenges? 
• How are you measuring your own success? 
• How responsive is customer service? 
• Has there been any down time? 
• What is the most useful, actionable (favorite) report the platform generates? • What do you wish they did differently? 
• Why would you recommend this platform? 
Although not all vendors require an annual contract, many do. Once you've selected a vendor, be  sure to get in writing a list of what features and support are covered in the contract. Make sure to  ask about the following:  
• What kinds of additional fees might come up? 
• Are there charges for custom design, and, if so, how much?  
• What is the hourly charge for engineering services, and is there a minimum?  • What partner organizations are available to install and integrate the platform?  • If we need you to train a new hire mid-year, what will that cost?  
Obtaining the answers up front - and having them in writing - will ensure fewer surprises or  additional costs down the road.
Before deciding  on a vendor,  
check out its  
online community  and review  
sites, and speak  with one or  
two customer  references,  
preferably  
someone in a  
business like  
yours.
