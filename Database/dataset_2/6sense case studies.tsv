https://6sense.com/customer-stories/how-coveo-transformed-their-targeting-and-gtm-strategy-using-6sense/	Coveo	Large	information technology and services	"For Coveo, a leader in AI-powered search and generative experiences, aligning marketing and sales teams presented an ongoing challenge and opportunity. The marketing and business development teams have been working closely together under the CMO to maximize communication and collaboration. Through this alignment they discovered that their traditional lead-focused approach across four business lines relied heavily on manual tracking and more.   Inconsistent and disconnected account-level data made it hard to measure marketing campaign ROI and accurately prioritize accounts, resulting in missed opportunities and inefficiencies..  Recognizing the need for change, Coveo set out to bridge the gap between marketing and sales, improve their data, and create a unified strategy to identify and engage high-potential accounts.   They turned to 6sense for the tech, data and support to power their transformation. Since then, Coveo has transformed its revenue creation process, moving to a data-driven, account-based approach that has empowered their marketing and sales teams to work in lockstep, resulting in increased efficiencies, and an increase in influenced opportunities.  The challenge Before the shift, Coveo’s marketing and sales teams were operating in AE-focused pods to avoid silos, but without a unified strategy collaboration was harder than it had to be.   As George Samaras, director of marketing operations and technology says, “historically, our process was very inbound-focused. We’d get an MQL. Then we’d pass it off to a business development rep. The lead might convert. They might not.”  Key challenges included:  Fragmented data sources, leading to inconsistent and unreliable lead tracking. Lack of alignment between marketing and sales, resulting in poor collaboration. Difficulty in identifying and prioritizing high-intent accounts, causing inefficiencies in the pipeline. These issues led to missed opportunities at accounts, prompting Coveo to seek a solution that would bring their teams together and streamline the entire revenue creation process.  The solution The biggest shift was in philosophy. Coveo made a strategic shift from a traditional lead-focused model to an account-based marketing (ABM) approach running in tandem focused on top accounts. This meant adopting a new approach and new tools to align revenue generation efforts. The integration of 6sense into Coveo’s infrastructure played a crucial role in transforming their revenue process.  Establishing the vision Coveo kicked off the implementation of 6sense by holding vision-setting meetings to align teams on the shift to ABM. Coveo made it clear that their focus was moving from lead generation to targeting high-value accounts, laying the groundwork for long-term revenue growth. They also provided comprehensive training and enablement sessions to familiarize marketing and sales teams with 6sense’s capabilities.   “Recognizing the potential of 6sense to revolutionize our marketing and sales alignment, we invested in the tool and began to shift our focus towards account-centric targeting. This initial phase laid the foundation for our comprehensive ABM strategy.”  George Samaras Director of Marketing Operations and Technology, Coveo Creating buy-in and ownership Key stakeholders from both marketing and sales were involved early in the process to create a sense of ownership. Weekly meetings helped ensure ongoing alignment. Coveo also hired dedicated ABM managers to drive the strategy. This cross-functional buy-in was vital to the success of the 6sense rollout.  “We created incentives for teams to adopt the new approach. This included recognizing and rewarding employees who effectively utilized 6sense data to achieve their targets and contribute to the overall success,” says George.   Integrating 6sense into GTM efforts Coveo seamlessly incorporated 6sense data into their go-to-market (GTM) approach, using it to track Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) based on behavioral triggers such as content engagement, event attendance, and demo requests. 6sense’s buying stage insights were layered into these processes, helping sellers prioritize accounts with high purchase intent that were nearing a decision.  “The integration of 6sense into our GTM strategy has been transformative. It has enabled us to align our marketing and sales efforts more effectively, prioritize high-intent accounts, and drive significant revenue growth,” says Mike Raley, SVP of Marketing.  Using 6sense Intent Data By monitoring 6sense Intent Scores, Coveo was able to segment leads into different stages of the buyer’s journey — TOFU, MOFU, BOFU — and tailor their nurture flows accordingly. Daily Hot Account alerts were sent to account executives and SDRs, allowing them to act quickly on accounts displaying high intent.  “6sense not only highlights accounts that are ready to engage — but what I like (and probably the most rewarding feature) is the “recent intent activities” that show up when you start outbounding to those accounts so you can see the results of your work.”  Haniya Hussain Sales Development Representative, Coveo Account monitoring and targeting Coveo also incorporated 6sense data into their Top Account Obsession play, using 6sense’s Account Profile Fit to identify high-potential accounts. Salesforce and Tableau dashboards further supported their efforts, providing real-time insights into account movement and campaign metrics to optimize resource allocation and engagement.  “6sense allows me to easily sort through my accounts to ensure I’m always prioritizing outreach to the accounts that are most likely to engage back. What’s even better is that with 6sense’s keyword data, I’m able to personalize my outreach to the specific area of interest that I’m seeing within the account.,” says James Ford, sales development representative.  The results Since integrating 6sense into their revenue process, Coveo has experienced significant improvements in both marketing and sales performance.   The ability to identify Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) that are in the Decision and Purchase stage has led to more precise targeting and outreach.  Daily monitoring and prioritization of high-intent accounts has allowed Coveo to allocate resources more effectively, leading to increased conversion rates.  In just 9 months in 2024, Coveo created 42 new business opportunities influenced by account-based GTM efforts — an increasingly meaningful contribution to overall pipeline creation. The impact across departments has been substantial:  Marketing: Precision targeting and personalized campaigns based on 6sense’s intent data have increased engagement and campaign efficiency, leading to higher conversion rates. Sales: Improved prioritization of high-intent accounts has resulted in more focused efforts, shorter sales cycles, and better conversion rates. Operations: The unification of data and automated workflows have streamlined pipeline management, reducing manual work and enabling faster, data-driven decision-making. These changes have fostered a culture of alignment and data-driven decision-making, positioning Coveo for continued success.  “6sense is our foundation for developing a precise and effective ABM ecosystem. It empowers us with unparalleled insights into buyer intent, guiding us to deliver personalized experiences and foster meaningful engagements that drive transformative business outcomes,” says Marilou Simard-Baril, Head of Account-Based Marketing."
https://6sense.com/customer-stories/bonterras-journey-with-6sense-transforming-abm-with-predictive-ai-and-sales-alignment/	Bonterra	Large	computer software	"Bonterra is one of the fastest-growing social good software companies in the world. Through innovative solutions for fundraising, corporate social responsibility, and case management, Bonterra is working towards increasing giving to 3% of U.S. GDP by 2033, unlocking $573 billion for more global good annually.   Justin Lopez, account-based marketing manager (ABM) at Bonterra, shares how the company pivoted their marketing strategy by implementing 6sense’s AI-powered revenue platform. Bonterra significantly improved targeting, engagement, and overall efficiency by focusing on account-based marketing (ABM).   The challenge: Overcoming inbound limitations and lack of account visibility Historically, Bonterra heavily relied on inbound leads to drive their sales pipeline. While this approach generated high lead volumes, it didn’t always translate into meaningful pipeline growth. The company faced several challenges:  Inbound limitations: The heavy focus on inbound marketing left in-market buyers untouched with strategies to capture their buying intent.  Lack of sales and marketing alignment: Sales and marketing felt a disconnect on target accounts. Sales lists churned quickly and were based on ICP fit that weren’t always aligned to Marketing definitions and there were no coordinated activities against these activities.   Challenges with targeting and messaging: Difficulties in refining targeting and aligning messaging limited Bonterra’s ability to effectively engage key accounts.  The solution: Implementing a sales-first, multi-channel ABM strategy Bonterra added 6sense Sales Intelligence to their predictive AI and ABM use case to shift from inbound only to outbound sales focused on 6sense insights. The implementation focused on refining targeting, improving sales alignment, and increasing campaign efficiency.   Smarter targeting with predictive AI: 6sense’s predictive analytics gave Bonterra insight into where accounts were in their buying journey. This helped prioritize high-intent accounts, allowing the team to focus on the most valuable opportunities.  Sales and marketing alignment: Bonterra emphasized close collaboration between sales and marketing to identify target accounts. They created POD models where AEs and BDRs meet weekly to discuss 6QAs and recent activities from key accounts, and next steps on multithreading. By working together, both teams aligned on account priorities and messaging, ensuring consistent outreach.  Multi-channel ABM campaigns: Audiences were synchronized across platforms like Meta and LinkedIn, ensuring target accounts received consistent messaging wherever they engaged. This multi-channel approach enhanced engagement. Data-driven optimization: Bonterra used real-time engagement data to refine their campaigns, focusing efforts on accounts showing the highest engagement. This data-driven approach improved overall campaign performance and resource allocation. 6sense’s Sales Intelligence dashboard has been a game changer for Bonterra’s sellers, namely the ‘Recent Activities’ tab and ‘Discovery’ feature. The ‘Recent Activities’ tab surfaces inbound actions like form fills and specific web visits. The ‘Discovery’ feature allows sellers to see engaged contacts that are increasing or decreasing engagement over a 7-day span. For Bonterra, the ‘Discovery’ feature helped find net-new contacts at their target accounts who have visited the website.   The information provided on 6sense dashboards has lit up Bonterra’s Dark Funnel, enabling sellers to have more guidance on which accounts to go after. Since using Sales Intelligence, Bonterra has noted an increase in website visits from target accounts.  “The ability for our go-to-market team to see which of our key accounts are engaging with our website or marketing ads in nearly real-time is a complete game-changer.”  Justin Lopez Account-Based Marketing Manager, Bonterra The results: Driving higher engagement and improved sales-marketing alignment After implementing 6sense, Bonterra experienced a transformative shift in how they approached marketing. With data-driven insights and enhanced collaboration between sales and marketing, the company saw substantial improvements in targeting, engagement, and overall efficiency.   “Comparing our account-based marketing ads to our non-ABM ads, we see both higher conversion rates and higher click-through rates. Across the board, our ABM metrics are stronger,” says Justin.   Here are Bonterra’s wins using 6sense since January of 2024:   6sense programs influenced $6M in pipeline, which is a 445% increase from the previous fiscal year 6763 target accounts driven to website  “Everything we’re doing from an outbound perspective would be so much harder without 6Sense,” admits Justin.   A data-driven path to Bonterra’s future growth By embracing 6sense’s AI-driven platform, Bonterra successfully transitioned from a dependence on inbound leads to a proactive, account-based marketing strategy. The synergy between sales and marketing improved engagement with key accounts and drove significant increases in conversion rates and overall efficiency in their go-to market strategy.  Bonterra’s journey illustrates the transformative power of predictive analytics and cross-team collaboration in executing effective ABM strategies. The company’s success is a valuable example for organizations looking to improve the efficiency of their marketing program while achieving greater alignment between sales and marketing teams."
https://6sense.com/customer-stories/marathon-healths-marketing-was-lonely-with-no-insights-now-they-have-millions-in-pipeline/	Marathon Health	Large	hospital & health care	"For years, Marathon Health, a nationwide network healthcare solution, risked missing out on millions of dollars of pipeline due to an overworked and understaffed go-to-market team. Capacity issues plagued their marketing and sales teams, resulting in too many unaddressed inbound requests, ignored accounts, and gaps in their marketing-to-sales qualification process.   But that’s not the case these days.   “When we implemented 6sense, we found higher quality leads, and drove net-new sales,” explains Troy Purdue, the company’s Director of Growth Marketing. ”Ultimately, it opened the door for us to engage with more members and change more people’s lives through the healthcare services we provide.”   Here’s how Marathon Health harnessed 6sense’s capabilities to streamline their sales process and attach millions of pipeline to marketing campaigns.   The challenge: Marketing or ‘arts and crafts’? Back in 2020, Marathon Health’s tech stack was  “lonely with no insights,” Troy confesses. Worse still, the marketing team fulfilled creative requests but had no demand-generation capabilities.  “The marketing team was what I would call an ‘arts and crafts’’ department,” Troy says. “We were putting flyers together, PowerPoint presentations, and all the standard type stuff that marketing would do. But marketing was not responsible for pipeline.”   While marketing was busy decorating posters, Marathon Health’s sales team purchased lists of contacts and made cold calls. This was a lengthy and oftentimes wasteful sales cycle because they were calling customers who had no intent to purchase.   Marathon Health’s previous tech stack provided a limited view of first-party data. It couldn’t deliver the crucial insights a sales team needs to reach companies that are actually looking for a solution. Deficiencies in the middle of the funnel meant Marathon Health lacked the resources to contact and nurture thousands of leads.   To scale the business and make a bigger impact, Marathon Health needed a solution to:   Empower their small marketing team to expand capabilities  Get better account insights, and  Own a pipeline number To meet this need, Marathon Health added 6sense to their toolkit in 2021. They adopted an omnichannel approach to their outreach, uniting all aspects of the buyer journey across all channels. They then later joined 6sense’s Email Agents beta in 2022 to help the sales team engage more efficiently with prospects.   Building a unique playbook with an omnichannel approach  Marathon Health first used 6sense in 2021 to build a unique omnichannel playbook that empowered them to monitor the impact of their engagement on the city level.   Geography is important in Marathon Health’s go-to-market strategy as the company is expanding their health center locations nationwide. The 6sense approach divided customers into segments based on zip codes and then AI-based scoring to view the marketing funnel at a granular level.  Next, 6sense’s orchestrations and Salesforce integrations equipped Marathon Health’s revenue team with access to data-complete accounts ready for engagement across multiple platforms.   Marathon Health’s omnichannel marketing playbook included:   Targeted ads customized for each market and stage Direct mail delivered to all companies meeting in the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)  AI-driven email journeys customized by buyer personas and market After initial targeting, sales development representatives (SDRs) handled the accounts that signaled a high intent to purchase. SDRs would engage these accounts with customized outreach on LinkedIn or phone calls.  Troy says 6sense makes it easy to monitor the impact of engagement levels per city and adjust the strategy or budget to yield better results more quickly. This omnichannel approach made the Marathon Health team more nimble and dramatically increased in-market buying growth.   However, they still had one gap to fill: contacting people via email at scale. That’s where 6sense’s Email Agents came into play.   Leveling up with Email Agents 6sense introduced a beta program for its Email Agents capability in the summer of 2022, and Marathon Health participated.   Email Agents is an AI-powered personalization tool that streamlines conversations by writing emails and responding to replies at scale. Agents treat every opportunity with high-quality engagement by replying to emails at any time, looping in necessary people, and understanding out-of-office messaging.   Since Marathon Health didn’t have the resources to contact thousands of people and nurture them through the marketing funnel, Email Agents gave Troy’s small team the capacity to contact more people and customize messaging based on geography, the industry, and the number of employees.   As a solution that offers in-person health networks based on geography, Marathon Health used Email Agents to create a targeted email journey personalized by city.  Within the first two months of using Email Agents, Marathon Health sent more than 22,000 emails with open rates reaching 38%, resulting in $4.5M in net-new pipeline. This percentage is a 55% increase over average email open rates from other health companies.   “If you can create a highly relevant email stream speaking specifically to the problems of your prospects, you can generate really, really high open rates, engagement rates, and ultimately closed-won deals,” Troy says.   Email Agents enables Marathon Health’s sales team members to engage more effectively with contacts and drive them further down the funnel.   This confidence extends to the marketing team, too.   “The marketing team owns a pipeline number now,” Troy says. “Talk about confidence when we didn’t have that before! We’re confident that not only can we meet that pipeline number, but exceed it.”   The results Marathon Health introduced 6sense in 2021 and generated astounding results after launching their first set of ad campaigns. Before using 6sense, Marathon Health’s pipeline and in-market buying growth were close to zero.   The results since July 2021:   $66M in net-new pipeline 211% in-market buying growth  In 2022, Marathon Health added Email Agents to close the conversation gap. Over the course of eight weeks and 22,000+ emails sent, Email Agents delivered:   11 qualified leads 908 accounts $4.5M net-new pipeline generated  In using the 6sense Revenue Intelligence Platform, Troy’s team can reach more people — and impact more lives — with Marathon Health’s services.   “We’re really just scratching the surface,” he says “If we can continue to invest in tools like 6sense and Email Agents and integrate other partners and platforms with 6sense, look at how much more we can generate and grow. That has instilled a level of confidence in me to be able to go to leadership and say, ‘let’s continue to do these wonderful things.”"
https://6sense.com/customer-stories/wake-the-dead-how-clari-used-6sense-display-ads-to-win-back-lost-accounts/	Clari	Medium	computer software	"When dealing with closed-lost accounts, most companies cut their losses and move on.   But Clari isn’t like most companies. Instead, they closely examine closed-lost accounts and find new ways to bring them back to life.   Or, at least, that’s what Tyler Pleiss and Derek Antti — Clari’s Senior Marketing Manager and Revenue Development Manager, respectively — set out to do with their recent “Wake the Dead” account-based strategy.  Using 6sense display ads, Clari’s Wake the Dead strategy reinvigorates closed-lost accounts. The initiative recently resulted in $1 million of qualified pipeline in just one quarter.   Clari secured major wins through Wake the Dead, but achieving these results first required learning how to take full advantage of 6sense’s solution.  The challenge Tyler and Derek joined Clari in early 2022. Although Clari was already using 6sense at the time, their revenue team was not using the platform to its full potential.   For instance, the team didn’t fully understand how to best leverage 6sense data, resulting in a “spray and pray” go-to-market strategy. Instead of focusing on logos expressing genuine buying intent, Clari’s sellers targeted any big brand that came to mind.   On top of that, the results they were seeing from LinkedIn Advertising hit a plateau. Tyler explains: “We got to a point, especially on the marketing side, where we were running a lot of stuff at one time. That can sometimes oversaturate the people you’re targeting.”   So, Tyler and Derek empowered their team to optimize 6sense data and capabilities, which culminated in its ultra-successful Wake the Dead strategy.   The solution Losing an opportunity doesn’t mean it’s gone forever. Further, the reasons why accounts don’t turn into a win can change or vanish over time. Looking back on a year’s worth of closed-lost opportunities, Clari sought specific criteria such as failure to launch, meeting no-shows, bad timing,  executive turnover, and budget restrictions.   To revive these closed-lost accounts, Clari had to:   Align revenue development managers (RDRs) and account executives  Align on messaging and assets, and Launch display ads using 6sense Clari’s use of 6sense Display Ads targets senior-level personas and sends them to curated landing pages powered by Folloze, a buyer experience platform.   Once accounts reach Clari’s website, Derek’s team of RDRs receives those buying signals and targets the proper accounts to generate new opportunities.   “It gives our RDRs another avenue that’s outside of outbound or following up with inbound,” Derek says. “Then you couple this with 6sense, where you get the data that tells you who to chase down and what they’re interested in.”  The results With 6sense, Clari’s revenue team went from making educated guesses to knowing exactly who to target and how.   As Tyler wrote in an article on LinkedIn, Clari targeted 42 accounts with a goal of six meetings booked, four qualified meetings, and $500k in pipeline.   By the end of Q4 of the 2023 fiscal year, they achieved:  Eight meetings booked  Five qualified meetings worth over $1.1M in pipeline  6sense Display Ads reached all 42 accounts with a 79% account click-through rate (CTR).   Additionally, 93% of accounts engaged with display ads, and 67% showed increased engagement on Clari’s website.   From a cultural perspective, Clari’s internal adoption of 6sense has produced impressive results. For example, from Q1 of the fiscal year 2024, 43% of meetings booked have come from 6sense purchase and decision accounts.   “We’ve seen 6sense be considered a strong source of data to help all of our sellers align their focus and attention on the accounts they target for the year, the quarter, the week, and the day,” Derek says."
https://6sense.com/customer-stories/khoros-delivers-personalized-web-experiences-to-their-most-valuable-audiences/	Khoros	Large	computer software	"Khoros provides a leading customer engagement platform that empowers organizations to build long-lasting relationships with their customers — and prospects — by creating powerful communities, managing social media communications, and aggregating feedback in a central location.  The team at Khoros leverages 6sense to deliver personalized web experiences, shorten deal cycles, and increase average deal size. With 6sense:  Sales cycles shortened by 42% Deal size increased 16% The challenge Khoros was doing a great job at providing a relevant user experience on its website … but it knew it could do more. Khoros’ site could more deeply resonate with visitors if it delivered personalized messaging aligning with  individual buyers’ unique needs.  Driving that level of customization with a two-person marketing team could be challenging. “We don’t have a lot of resources. Something like this honestly could take a whole full-time position,” explains Nathan Stull, Khoros’ senior manager of web marketing.  Stull and others knew they needed an alternative solution to realize their goals — while also maintaining a lean team and tech stack.  The solution Khoros turned to 6sense and Bound360 to tackle the challenge. Getting started was simple thanks to seamless integrations between 6sense, Bound360, and the team’s existing tech stack (which included Salesforce).  Rather than create unique content experiences across the website for all of Khoros’ constituents, Stull and his team realized they could take a phased approach that mitigated risk through tech integrations. They could incrementally build on small successes.  “You don’t have to do it all right away,” Stull says. “You don’t even need to know all the audiences. All you need is a high quality audience.  From there, you have a launching pad.”  Mary Clare Davis, vice president of strategy and product at Bound360, concurs.  “People get daunted because there is so much you can do,” she says. “That’s what we always say to our customers: ‘Pick one goal for that audience.’ Don’t allow the possibilities to overwhelm you.”  Powerful personalization with global ambitions Stull creates personalized web experiences based on Khoros’ internal data, 6sense intent data, and Bound360’s behavioral data. He relies on Bound360 to build the customized campaigns and successfully deliver the right content to the right audience. This enables Stull and his team to focus on strategy.  “There are top industries we target, segments in 6sense we use, and also user behavior [from Bound360] to segment and enhance their web experience,” he explains.  With this powerful tech combination in place, Khoros now personalizes huge sections of its website. Numerous modules and entire pages now cater to the specific needs and concerns of the users landing on the site.  And it’s creating a big impact. Recently, a personalized content experience on the site drove 68% of all registrations to a Khoros event.  “What’s really interesting is how in six months it’s evolved so much,” Stull says. The team rapidly went from no personalization to now dreaming about global expansion. Discussions are already underway for personalizing the company’s sites for Australia, France, and Germany.  The company is a shining standard for website personalization, says Bound360’s Davis.  “Khoros has been the perfect user of a personalization solution because they have a really clear idea of who they want to target and what they want those people to see,” she says.  The results Stull and his team now deliver personalized web content to a diverse set of audiences. Within six months, the team’s personalization efforts have driven real results, including:  22% of all visitors received personalization More than 4x increase in demo request conversion rate for visitors who saw personalization Pages per session was nearly 2x higher for visitors who engaged with personalization These results have enabled Stull to highlight his team’s impact to the wider organization."
https://6sense.com/customer-stories/manufacturer-nanawall-gains-the-competitive-edge-with-6sense/	NanaWall	Small	manufacturing	"NanaWall, a major manufacturer of opening glass wall systems, isn’t a newcomer to Account-Based Marketing (ABM). In fact, the industry leader used an account-based approach to sales and marketing before “ABM” was a common phrase.  For years, NanaWall’s revenue team paired its ABM strategy with a few predictive analytics tools that helped score opportunities. But 6sense dramatically improved the team’s efficiency and impact by empowering it to:  Capture information about website visitors Trace non-click ad engagement Evaluate ad placement Coordinate marketing and sales efforts The challenge The manufacturing industry isn’t a big user of martech, which had been a longtime competitive differentiator for NanaWall.  But as ABM and predictive analytics technologies continually improved, NanaWall sought to maintain its industry-leading position. It took a look at 6sense.  6sense’s ability to combine account fit and engagement scoring especially intrigued stakeholders at Nanawall. Other solutions simply focused on account fit.  Benefits drive insights & growth NanaWall became an enthusiastic user of 6sense. The list of benefits its revenue team discovered underscores why its efforts have been so successful. 6sense can:  Extend predictive solutions in existing CRMs Create campaigns and segments hyper-targeted to accounts Exclude accounts from display Build dynamic segments that learn and adjust to criteria Establish filters to bubble up people or accounts ready for attention That last one is one of Rapolla’s favorites. “This feature is really awesome because we don’t have to re-analyze our audience and create new, static buckets,” he says. “We establish filters that automatically feed people or accounts into a segment that meets them when they need to be met.”  Making the invisible visible 6sense’s engagement analytics made an enormous — and immediate — difference for NanaWall. While there are tried-and-true tactics that produce good leads for follow-up, buyers continually conduct research in ways that selling teams can’t see.  “There’s so much engagement that happens on the website, and since people don’t fill out forms, we don’t know who they are,” Rapolla says. “And if we don’t know who they are, we don’t have the ability to target them when that engagement happens. Using 6sense to uncover this data is big.”  Advertising success beyond click-through rates 6sense’s digital ad capabilities are also a game-changer for NanaWall. The platform delivers robust insights on campaign performance, including account view-through rate.  VTR offers more actionable information than traditional click-through rate information does. This is because VTR reveals the accounts that are seeing NanaWall’s ads but aren’t necessarily clicking through.  Before 6sense, NanaWall assumed that when ad campaigns didn’t generate a high click-through rate weren’t working. But with 6sense, stakeholders can now see when accounts exposed to those ads (but didn’t click through) visit the company’s website anyway.  This additional intent data helps inform valuable next steps for NanaWall’s revenue team.  The results NanaWall has extended its use of 6sense to the entire revenue team. Now the sales team interprets and leverage marketing-campaign data to guide hyper-targeted, account-based outreach.  NanaWall’s industry-leading use of 6sense transformed its ability to reach and evaluate accounts. Its teams can now:  Break down the invisible wall around website visitors Follow ad effectiveness without click-through rates Ensure ad placement on reputable sites Unite efforts across marketing and sales And stakeholders like working with 6sense, too.  “Beyond the capabilities of the platform, a core influencer for choosing 6sense is working with the people,” Rapolla says. “Our use case is very unique and atypical. So we needed a little more attention, even though we are a small company. We were able to get that from 6sense.”"
https://6sense.com/customer-stories/conversational-email-the-compass-in-vendavos-tech-stack/	Vendavo	Large	computer software	"For pricing management and optimization platform, Vendavo, poor timing on lead follow-ups resulted in money lost.  “Leads would come in, and they would just sit there for days and weeks or were ignored completely,” Steve Hastert, Director of Marketing at Vendavo, explains.  Those leads no longer go ignored, thanks to 6sense Email Agents, an AI-powered tool that makes it easy to scale personalized email conversations with thousands of buyers.  Vendavo participated in 6sense’s Email Agent beta in summer 2022. Within just a few weeks, Email Agents helped a lean sales team engage thousands of contacts and increase average meetings booked by 10%.  Let’s dive deeper into the challenges facing Vendavo’s sales team and how 6sense helps rookie sales team members close more deals.  The challenge: Making a big impact with a lean SDR team Like many growing businesses, Vendavo has a small team of sales development representatives (SDRs): five in the U.S. and three in Europe, each with a tenure of around five months. When it comes to engaging prospects, this short tenure can put the SDRs at a disadvantage, explains Rich Fong, Vendavo’s Senior Manager of Sales Development.  “Learning our product is not easy,” he explains, “It’s software, and it’s a lot to learn. It is hard for SDRs to get on board quickly, come up with messaging, and get in front of all the leads.”  Vendavo’s ideal customer profile includes manufacturers and distributors that generate more than $1 billion annually. Thousands of companies are within Vendavo’s total addressable market (TAM), which means each SDR has hundreds of contacts.  “An SDR can’t do the research and personalization for everyone engaging with us,” Rich says. “Email Agents helped us bridge that execution gap.”  Rich Fong Senior Manager, Sales Development, Vendavo The Solution: AI-Powered Assistant, ‘Lisa’ 6sense Email Agents are AI-powered personalization tools that streamline conversations between sales reps and contacts by automatically writing emails and responding to replies at scale. Email Agents treat every opportunity with high-quality engagement by replying to emails at any time, looping in necessary people, and understanding out-of-office messaging.  Email Agents have now become a staple in Vendavo’s go-to-market strategy.  “It started as a solution to just generate emails. But now, Email Agents are fully executing campaigns and following up with leads that our SDRs didn’t have the bandwidth to go after.”  Rich Fong Senior Manager, Sales Development, Vendavo Vendavo website visitors who download content such as data sheets and ebooks are placed into an MQL dashboard visible to SDRs. Then the Email Agents takes over.  After a seven day waiting period, an AI-assistant named ‘Lisa’ will begin outreach. Companies using Email Agents select the name of the AI-assistant, which handles everything from initial outreach to scheduling follow-ups.  Rich also mentioned that all SDRs are part of the 6QA (6sense Qualified Account) process, which enables revenue teams to align on when in-market accounts are ready to convert into an opportunity. This enhances their AI-assisted email strategy because SDRs can prioritize which accounts to engage via email.  The Results When it comes to the overall impact, Rich and Steve are on the same page.  “Looking forward to the future, I feel excited about additional campaigns we can run with Email Agents, potential 6QA accounts, event leads, or areas we might need help on,” Rich says.  “The most impactful thing is reaching out to those folks we had talked to and then moved on from. Getting those back in the sales process has been the biggest win,” Steve says. Rich adds, “It’s given us more clarity on what’s hot or not regarding accounts. I also liken it to a compass. It directionally helps us find those hot or not accounts. Our sellers can see it. Our SDRs can see it. Our marketers can see it.”  In just six weeks, the AI assistant delivered the same results as three human SDRs, totaling:  24 qualified contacts Nine meetings booked Two opportunities Results grew significantly, and in 2022 overall, the AI Assistant ‘Lisa’ delivered for Vendavo 66 qualified contacts, 19 meetings booked, and 10 opportunities totaling $3.3M SaaS pipeline."

By combining Gainsight health scores with 6sense’s targeting capabilities, they’ve created a sophisticated approach to customer expansion that’s transforming their enterprise relationships.     The Challenge   CallMiner was wrestling with a familiar challenge for enterprise software: helping customers maximize value from their platform. With customers spanning multiple industries and use cases, their technology often started in contact centers but has the power to deliver insights across departments.    “Our customers come in all different shapes and sizes, industries, and use cases,” says Alexandra Robson, global head of demand gen and marketing at CallMiner. This diversity created several hurdles:    Breaking through organizational silos that prevented wider adoption   Supporting customer champions in demonstrating value to other departments   Delivering relevant resources based on varying customer maturity levels   Identifying and engaging new stakeholders who could benefit from the platform   The Solution   Rather than taking a one-size-fits-all approach to customer marketing, CallMiner developed an innovative strategy using Gainsight health scores to drive their digital advertising through 6sense. This allowed them to segment customers based on maturity and tailor messaging accordingly.    “We segmented our adverts based on what customers need at different stages. Red health customers might need onboarding resources or information about our out-of-box solutions. Yellow health customers might benefit from best practices and community insights. And green customers, who are already doing well with our platform, might want to learn about new features or innovative use cases to enhance their ROI and business benefits.”  Alexandra Robson Global Head of Demand Gen This approach enables CallMiner’s customer success (CS) team to be more proactive in their customer engagement. Integration between 6sense’s digital advertising and internal customer success and growth workflows creates new opportunities for meaningful outreach. When the CS or growth team sees engagement with specific content, they can quickly follow up with relevant resources and support tailored to the customer’s maturity level. The strategy is particularly effective in large enterprises, where finding new stakeholders is crucial for expansion.  “Because we’re advertising at the account level rather than the person level, we can reach people within these organizations that we didn’t even know had an interest in these capabilities,” says Alexandra. “It helps our internal champions penetrate other parts of their business.”     The Results   CallMiner’s strategy has yielded promising early results, with particular success in driving influenced form fills and increased engagement from existing customers. This has helped the CallMiner team identify new stakeholders within their accounts and create opportunities for expansion.    But the impact goes beyond metrics. The program has transformed how CallMiner engages with customers, shifting from reactive to proactive engagement. “Historically, our approach has been a little more reactive than proactive.,” reflects Alexandra. “Now we’re more strategic about prioritizing where our teams spend their time.”    CallMiner’s ABM-focused strategy has delivered significant, quantifiable improvements across key customer metrics:   Account Health Progression:   50% of red health ABM target customer accounts advanced to yellow, compared to just 15% of red non-ABM accounts.  Likewise, 48% of yellow health ABM targets moved up to green, far outpacing the 19% seen in yellow non-ABM accounts.  Accelerated Value Realization:   Green health ABM accounts saw an average annual contract value (ACV) that was 10% higher than that of green standard (non-ABM) accounts.  These outcomes highlight the impact of CallMiner’s health score-driven ABM approach, accelerating customer maturity and driving higher revenue expansion across their customer base.    The success of their customer-focused ABM has also influenced their broader marketing strategy. CallMiner now maintains “always-on” campaigns for their top prospect accounts, segmented by vertical and aligned with sales priorities. This ensures marketing provides air cover while BDR and sales teams actively work on their target accounts.    By rethinking how ABM technology can serve existing customers, CallMiner has pioneered a new approach to enterprise customer engagement. Their innovative use of health scores for segmentation demonstrates how companies can use 6sense’s capabilities beyond traditional prospect targeting to drive value across their entire customer lifecycle.

https://6sense.com/customer-stories/reachdesk-achieves-35-win-rate-with-6sense-intent-data/	Reachdesk	Medium	marketing and advertising	"The sales team at Reachdesk, a global gifting platform, starts each day with a ritual that has revolutionized their pipeline: checking 6sense intent signals to identify their most promising opportunities.    Over the past three years, this routine has enabled Reachdesk to create a more efficient, data-driven sales process that consistently delivers measurable results.   The Challenge  Before implementing 6sense, Reachdesk struggled with a disjointed system that lacked centralized visibility into buyer intent. Their sales team faced significant challenges:   No clear way to identify which accounts were in-market and ready to buy  Limited visibility into prospect engagement with marketing content and their website  Difficulty prioritizing outreach efforts because of limited visibility into prospect buying stages  Inefficient targeting that led to lower conversion rates  No integrated view to show the interplay between marketing activities and sales engagement  “We just didn’t have an understanding of which accounts might be in-market, and couldn’t tie keyword searches or content consumption to website visitors,” says Ben Smith, Marketing Director at Reachdesk.    Ben adds, “It used to be that we were doing a lot of guesswork. Our outbound strategy lacked teeth because we didn’t really know who was ready. Now, we do.”    To power and improve their account-based marketing approach, Reachdesk needed a solution that would enable their team to make data-driven decisions about which accounts to prioritize and when to reach out.   The Solution  Reachdesk implemented 6sense as their intent data platform, making it a central part of their daily sales operations. BDRs pull daily reports of accounts showing 6sense intent signals. They examine the type of intent — website visits, keyword searches — through the 6sense widget in Salesforce. No need to switch between applications. The key info is right there in the CRM.     “Out of all the signals we look at on a daily basis, 6sense intent signals always seem to be the strongest in terms of who’s most likely to enter the funnel and ultimately close,” says Brandon Ray, Reachdesk’s Head of Global OB Demand Generation.    Ben shares that embedding 6sense into their entire go-to-market motion was key: “It’s not just a tool that marketing owns. Sales lives in it. Our entire GTM team treats it as the source of truth.”    This data provides insights into who is taking action within target accounts, which helps BDRs develop targeted outreach plans. Sales managers monitor the platform to ensure all signals are acted upon, while marketing creates segments to coordinate campaigns with sales activities.    Reachdesk also uses 6sense’s integration capabilities, connecting with Salesloft for orchestrated outreach and their own gifting platform to re-engage prospects. More recently, they’ve incorporated 6sense AI Email Agents to automate follow-ups, which has yielded impressive results.    “We ran a campaign with AI Email Agents. Anyone that had claimed a gift in the past through Reachdesk, we followed up with automated emails. We had a 50% close rate on opportunities generated from that play,” says Ben.   The Results  Reachdesk has seen measurable outcomes from 6sense that directly impact their revenue motion:   35% win rate from accounts showing 6sense buying signals (significantly above average)  65% conversion rate from key accounts to sales-accepted opportunities with 6sense intent data (compared to 50% for accounts without intent signals)  Greater global visibility into prospect engagement across EMEA, North America, and APAC regions    Ben sums it up: “It’s the difference between being reactive and proactive. We’re not waiting for someone to fill out a form — we’re reaching out to them at the right time, with the right message, because we can see the buying signals.”    About 6sense, Brandon says, “I can’t imagine a world without it. It would just be a guessing game in terms of who we should be reaching out to and when.” Combining 6sense intent data and Reachdesk’s gifting platform is what Brandon calls “the best one-two punch in terms of generating the type of pipeline that closes.” "
https://6sense.com/customer-stories/papercut-connects-the-marketing-dots-with-6sense-driving-9x-roi/	PaperCut Software		computer software	"For established B2B software companies, moving beyond broad marketing approaches to targeted account-based strategies can feel like an overwhelming transformation. PaperCut Software, a leader in print management technology, faced this challenge and turned to 6sense to bridge the gap.   Adam Byer, PaperCut’s performance marketing lead, shares how they made the transition from “hoping we’re hitting the right accounts” to precisely engaging prospects at every stage of the buying journey.   The Challenge  Despite being a leader in their industry for years, PaperCut’s marketing approach had room to mature.    “We were executing campaigns efficiently, but knew we could improve targeting and measurement,” says Adam. “We’d receive campaign ideas from outside the team and execute them with a fairly untargeted approach.”   The team knew they could do better. With a niche but broad IT audience to reach, they recognized the need to move beyond broad-spectrum campaigns toward something more focused and strategic. Their existing model meant limited visibility into the customer journey, with metrics primarily centered around click-through rates and initial conversions rather than full-funnel attribution.   As marketing developed more sophisticated campaign structures, they reached an inflection point. They had established their target audiences, developed persona maps, and created solid campaign frameworks. Now they needed a tool to put these elements into action and connect them with the right accounts at precisely the right time.   The Solution  In 2023, PaperCut implemented 6sense, starting with ABM and orchestrations capabilities. Rather than viewing it as a single solution to all their challenges, they approached 6sense as the central nervous system.    “6sense is a tool that enables you to connect all these other tools and ideas across your marketing stack and your business,” Adam says.   This philosophy guided their implementation strategy. The team quickly developed six distinct segments across their key verticals in the US and mapped campaigns to every stage of the buying journey. From awareness to consideration to decision and purchase, PaperCut created touchpoints throughout the entire customer journey.   The approach incorporated:   Integrated website personalization: By connecting 6sense with a marketing automation platform, PaperCut personalizes website content based on account segments and buying stages, delivering tailored messaging to visitors.  Cross-functional buying stage framework: The team uses 6sense’s buying stages and adapts them to match their unique industry positioning, creating a shared language for marketing and sales.  Custom data reporting: Using 6sense’s data packs, they built custom reporting dashboards through Power BI to connect marketing engagement with sales outcomes Foundation for outbound: Perhaps most significantly, 6sense has enabled PaperCut to enhance their outbound capabilities — a major evolution for a company that had previously relied exclusively on inbound marketing.  The Results  Implementing 6sense has helped PaperCut mature its marketing strategy. Key results include:   9x ROI on marketing spend through targeted ABM campaigns  Enhanced website personalization tailored to specific verticals and buying stages  Better internal alignment between marketing and sales teams  Data-driven customer journey insights providing visibility into account progression  6sense has also enabled the PaperCut marketing team to showcase their strategy across the organization. “The biggest impact has been the framework to talk to the rest of the company internally and our stakeholders about what we’re doing,” says Adam. “We can say, ‘This is exactly what we’re doing for this customer.’ Being able to tell that story has been massive for us to get buy-in from stakeholders and the leadership team.”"
https://6sense.com/customer-stories/yulife-unlocks-market-expansion-and-drives-growth-with-6sense/	YuLife	Medium	insurance	"With a strong foundation in the UK market, YuLife wanted to expand within the United States, which required a strategic shift in go-to-market execution.   CMO Lauren Berkemeyer has been instrumental in leading this transformation. “When we started, we had a strong sense of our target accounts but needed deeper intelligence to understand the ‘when’ — when was the right moment to engage?” she explains.   That’s where 6sense came in. By integrating 6sense into both sales and partner-driven motions, the company amplified its ability to prioritize accounts, tailor messaging, and drive high-value engagements.   The challenge: Scaling expansion & partner enablement   Before implementing 6sense, the company faced two key challenges:   Expanding into the US market: Their UK-based go-to-market (GTM) approach relied on selling to employers. In the US, however, they pivoted to a carrier partnership-led strategy, requiring a new way to identify and engage high-value partners.  Partner enablement: Historically, employee benefits advisers operated in a price-driven, transactional model. To stand out, YuLife needed a way to equip partners with valuable data insights, helping them adopt a more consultative approach.  Ray Wong, Revenue Operations Expert for YuLife, describes the complexity: “Brokers weren’t used to looking at account-level data. We needed to show them how data-driven insights could help them win more deals, and that required a shift in mindset.”   The solution: 6sense’s data-driven intelligence   Optimizing b2b sales outreach   Using 6sense’s intent data and timeline insights, the sales team could track account activity in real time. This allowed SDRs to time outreach more precisely, resulting in:   Faster engagement with high-intent accounts  Personalized conversations based on a prospect’s research journey  Improved pipeline efficiency with stronger qualification criteria  “The timeline feature in 6sense is invaluable,” says Ray. “We can see when a company starts researching key terms, visits our website, or engages with competitors. That means SDRs aren’t just calling randomly — they’re reaching out at the perfect time.”   Powering broker & partner success  Beyond internal sales, 6sense played a crucial role in strengthening adviser partnerships. By using 6sense’s intent data, YuLife can share high-intent account lists with advisers, enabling them to focus on the most promising opportunities.   Lauren explains, “We’ve shifted from simply providing brokers with leads to empowering them with data-driven intelligence. Instead of competing on price, they can now engage in more meaningful, value-based conversations with customers.”   Through this new approach, the company has been able to:   Increase adviser-driven deals by helping partners target the right accounts  Enhance trust and relationships by providing actionable insights to partners  Expand the total addressable market (TAM) by 3x through 6sense-powered data  The results: Accelerated growth & stronger conversions  Since implementing 6sense, YuLife has seen significant improvements across their sales and partnership channels:   29% close rate when incorporating 6sense data into targeting, compared to 15% before  3x increase in total addressable market (TAM) through expanded targeting capabilities  Stronger adviser partnerships by providing data-driven insights that improve deal flow  Ray sums up the transformation: “Before 6sense, we had a strong understanding of who to target. But now, we also know when to engage them, which has completely changed the game for us.”   Looking ahead: Expanding the 6sense playbook  With 6sense deeply embedded in their GTM strategy, YuLife is looking to further enhance its approach by expanding usage into AI Email Agents and automated workflows. Additionally, the company is continuously refining its partner enablement strategy, using data to help brokers become more consultative sellers.   Lauren adds, “We’ve only scratched the surface of what 6sense can do. There’s so much more potential, and we’re excited to keep evolving how we leverage it to drive growth.”   By integrating 6sense’s AI-powered insights across both b2b sales and partner channels, YuLife has been able to scale efficiently, improve targeting precision, and drive stronger deal conversions. Their journey showcases how account intelligence and intent data can fuel both internal sales teams and external partner networks, leading to higher-value engagements and long-term growth. "
https://6sense.com/customer-stories/how-simpro-is-transforming-global-revenue-generation-with-6sense-ai-email-agents/	Simpro	Medium	computer software	"In the dynamic world of field service management solutions, Simpro, a global software group operating in six countries, faced a pivotal challenge: how to evolve from a purely inbound marketing approach to a more strategic, account-based model.    Under the guidance of Tim Lamb, vice president of growth marketing, strategically chose to focus on the UK market as a proving ground for their transformation with 6sense.   The global challenge: Choosing a focus market  Simpro encountered a scenario common to many global companies:   The company operated across multiple countries, each with unique market dynamics.  Marketing relied heavily on inbound strategies, which were responsible for 85-90% of pipeline generation globally.  Sales and marketing teams operated in silos across regions, often with misaligned goals.  The company aspired to move upmarket but lacked a unified account-based marketing (ABM) approach.  The strategic decision: Focusing on the UK  “We did not do any account-based marketing. We actually were almost 100% inbound,” Tim shares, emphasizing the significant shift in strategy that was about to unfold.   Recognizing the need for a targeted approach, Simpro made the strategic decision to focus their transformation efforts on the UK market. This allowed the company to pilot their new ABM strategy in a key region before potentially rolling it out globally.   The solution: Embracing 6sense and ABM with a UK focus  Tim championed the adoption of 6sense as the cornerstone of Simpro’s new ABM strategy.   In early 2023, Simpro began implementing 6sense in the UK, leading to several UK-centric initiatives:   Adopting both Sales Intelligence (SI) and ABM components of 6sense for the UK market.  Creating the UK Pipeline Council, a cross-functional team to foster collaboration.  Providing comprehensive 6sense training to UK sales and marketing teams.  Overcoming hurdles: A global company’s local effort  The transition wasn’t without challenges, especially in adapting global strategies to the UK market. “We went to 6sense’s user conference, Breakthrough, in 2023 and were happy to hear that we weren’t the only ones. It was incredibly common to relaunch it and do an ‘okay, take two,'” Tim admitted.   The team had to learn how to leverage 6sense’s insights while maintaining the personal touch British businesses appreciate.   New leadership support proved crucial in driving the strategy forward across teams. “We got a new CEO and CRO, and they started to get behind this, saying, ‘No, we need sales bought into this as well,'” Tim explained. This executive backing helped align global strategy with local execution in the UK.   A UK success story with global implications  Simpro’s commitment to the new ABM strategy in the UK delivered impressive results:   125% of revenue target achieved in Q2 in the UK.  126% increase in average deal size year-to-date.  1.7x higher close-won rate for outbound efforts compared to inbound leads.  Perhaps most impressively, the UK became the revenue leader in closed-won Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) for the first time in Simpro’s history, demonstrating the effectiveness of its focused ABM strategy.   Building on this success, Simpro is exploring new avenues to further enhance its marketing efforts and drive even greater engagement and results. Additionally, the company needed to inject more automation to support its upmarket push while it broadened its field service management global footprint through acquisitions of Clockshark, AroFlo and BigChange. One of those avenues is 6sense’s Email Agents, which automate email outreach and intelligently responds to prospect replies.   Automating further success with Email Agents Leading the charge of Simpro’s Email Agents implementation is Megan Parks, Demand Generation Manager, and Jennifer Nelson, Director of Growth Marketing.   After learning more about Email Agents at 6sense’s annual user conference, Breakthrough, in October 2024, Simpro discovered they could use 6sense’s Email Agents to address specific challenges and improve outreach strategies:   Lead qualification: They needed a more efficient way to qualify leads, particularly from inbound sources. Handoff processes: Streamlining the handoff of leads from marketing to sales was a critical issue. Communication efficiency: Ensuring timely and effective follow-up with leads was challenging, especially when Business Development Representatives (BDRs) were unavailable due to vacations or sickness. Automation: There was a desire to automate communication processes to reduce the workload on BDRs and improve overall lead management. “What excited everyone about Email Agents was all the different types of use cases and campaigns it supported.  We liked the idea of having a fifth BDR without adding headcount.”  Megan Parks Demand Generation Manager So, Simpro began with rolling out Email Agents to BDRs to improve customer lifecycle communication, specifically for prospects. The implementation strategy focused on inbound campaigns in Australia, which are generally lower in the funnel and less cold compared to outbound campaigns. This approach was chosen to achieve quick wins and develop a robust playbook for future expansions.   “Email Agents do the dirty work for BDRs, which allows them to focus their time on more inbound efforts.”  Jennifer Nelson Director of Growth Marketing Initial metrics prove the campaign to be a success achieving a 42% reply rate and 23% qualified rate, which are both notably higher than typical outcomes without Email Agents.   The positive impact of Email Agents has been felt beyond quantifiable results. The Simpro has noticed additional benefits, such as:   Higher lead influx: Email Agents have helped generate more leads. Efficient outreach: The streamlined outreach process has reduced overthinking, making outreach more effective.  Self-serve experience: Potential customers had a more self-serve experience, which has improved their engagement. Lead qualification: With Email Agents pre-qualifying leads, BDRs only target the most promising prospects.  Consistent follow-up: Leads were not missed due to delays or human error since Email Agents provide consistent follow-up even when team members are unavailable. “What I love most about Email Agents is the peace of mind it provides. We know that no matter what, leads are being followed up with.”  Megan Parks Demand Generation Manager Simpro’s Email Agent rollout has been a success, demonstrating significant improvements in lead qualification and BDR support. By maintaining a personal touch and ensuring consistent follow-up, the team has not only achieved promising results but also laid the groundwork for future expansions and integrations."
https://6sense.com/customer-stories/how-a-leading-fintech-company-accelerated-direct-sales-in-a-new-market-using-6sense/	Undisclosed Leading FinTech Company	Large	financial services	"In early 2023, a leading FinTech company explored the viability of selling payment processing services directly to merchants. Building on their prior success with 6sense in scaling account-based marketing (ABM) in the enterprise segment, the company used 6sense’s ABM and sales intelligence tools to reach this new group of buyers.  As a result of business alignment and collaboration, by September 2023, the company closed more business in the subsequent 10 months than in the previous seven years combined.   The challenges The transition to direct-to-merchant sales came with challenges: this leading FinTech firm needed to  adapt sales processes, enhance their tech stack, and redefine their ideal customer profile (ICP).   Selling to enterprise businesses is different from selling to direct-to-merchant companies. Enterprise sales take up to six months because they involve building relationships and trust. Direct-to-merchant (D2M)  buyers move more quickly, so the team needed support in finding ways to show value to buyers immediately.   Meeting the demands of this new D2M strategy also required a tech stack upgrade. The D2M strategy would dramatically increase sales volume, so they needed a streamlined tech stack to support the surge in activity, respond to leads faster, and maintain efficiency.   Finally, the company had to define and understand a new ideal customer profile (ICP). They wanted to be as precise as possible in identifying their target audience. Since the features of potential customers constantly evolve, they needed a tool that’d automatically update ICPs as the target audience changed.   “Getting crystal clear on our ICP was a work-in-progress. This proved to be both challenging from a marketing and lead generation standpoint, as well as a sales standpoint,” says the company’s head of revenue operations.   These challenges underscore the need for a robust, adaptable approach to fully capture opportunities through strategic adjustments and improved use of 6sense  The solution The company’s senior revenue operations manager says 6sense’s early success with the strategy shift inspired confidence.   “There was a lot of uncertainty. But by using 6sense, we’ve been able to get really specific on who we’re trying to target. We focused on the most successful customers, brought them into our funnel, and showed some instant gains early on, which put leadership at ease.”   Now, 6sense has emerged as a cornerstone of their strategy across multiple departments.   “We have our ABM platform that we use on the marketing side of the house. The sales side uses 6sense sales intelligence capabilities. Both teams use 6sense keywords, making sure we are getting the customers we want to go after, but also the intent data.”  Senior Revenue Operations Manager Business Development 6sense Sales Intelligence tools have become invaluable for the company’s sales development representatives (SDRs) and account executives (AEs). With features like real-time alerts, sales can easily prioritize and pursue the most promising accounts, which has allowed their team to adapt their sales processes.   6sense also offers deep insights into prospects, enabling sales to quickly and accurately identify and reach the right contacts within target organizations.   Digital advertising The marketing team uses 6sense to gain a competitive edge in digital advertising. By analyzing insights on competitors’ strategies provided by 6sense, the team has been able to craft top-notch marketing campaigns that increase inbound traffic and improve brand awareness for both their enterprise platform and direct merchant ICPs.  This strategic use of competitor insights ensures that the company remains a step ahead in the highly competitive FinTech market.  Additionally, the company has found success using 6sense intent data to uncover new opportunities. 6sense data unexpectedly helped them define a new ICP within larger-scale D2M companies.   Sales and marketing alignment Finally, enhancements to the company’s tech stack like making HubSpot their CRM has contributed to marketing and sales alignment.   HubSpot’s seamless integration with 6sense enabled them to streamline lead management, automate workflows, and provide real-time data insights. These improvements let their teams handle the increase in activity well. This made it easier to respond to leads and keep working efficiently even though the business grew quickly.  “The fact that sales and marketing are talking in a common language is so important. Not only are we attracting people on the demand gen side of the house and getting them into the funnel, but they are actually people our sales team want,” the company’s senior revenue operations manager says.   The head of revenue operations also reflects on this alignment:  “I have been impressed with our sales teams’ ability to remain agile as our company undergoes a period of major transformation. Additionally, 6sense integrates well with other tools in our tech stack, so sales not only has the info they need but can easily harvest and use that data to close more sales.”   The results The company’s efforts have yielded remarkable results:  Enhanced lead flow velocity: Using 6sense enables teams to get and respond to leads more quickly.  Increased connect and close rates: Enhanced insights into prospects helped them identify the right contacts within target organizations and have stronger conversations. Marketing improvements: There was a noticeable improvement in brand awareness campaigns, increased inbound traffic, and a better understanding of competitors’ strategies. Ultimately, the strategic insights and tools provided by 6sense have enabled them to understand and capture a huge new group of customers.  The company’s senior revenue operations manager says 6sense has made their life easier:  “It’s important for me to be able to have enough in our funnel so our team feels confident. By having our teams use 6sense, they feel comfortable and trust the platform to produce results,” "
https://6sense.com/customer-stories/dialpad-elevates-digital-abm-with-6sense-professional-services/	Dialpad	Large	telecommunications	"When Dialpad set out to build their digital account-based marketing program in late 2023, they knew they needed more than just powerful platform capabilities — they needed expertise to maximize their investment and accelerate results.   As digital ABM manager at Dialpad, Shanelle Rucker brought valuable experience implementing 6sense in her previous roles. But rather than following the traditional path of working with an external agency, she saw an opportunity to take a different approach.    The challenge As the sole practitioner managing Dialpad’s digital ABM initiatives, Shanelle had several hurdles to overcome:   Building and scaling a new ABM program while learning the intricacies of 6sense’s advertising capabilities  Creating consistent, effective creative strategies across multiple product lines  Optimizing campaign performance without the bandwidth to constantly monitor and adjust tactics  Maintaining strategic focus while managing day-to-day campaign operations  Optimizing results while staying within budget   Recognizing that building a successful ABM program would require both platform expertise and dedicated support, Dialpad turned to 6sense Professional Services. This team specializes in campaign strategy, execution, optimization, and performance analysis to help customers maximize their marketing investments.   The solution Shannelle partnered with 6sense Professional Services to establish a collaborative weekly rhythm focused on strategic planning.    “Having a professional service’s expertise lets me focus on building the broader ABM program knowing our campaigns are in expert hands. We strategize as advertisers together, combining her platform knowledge with my understanding of Dialpad’s needs.”  Shanelle Rucker Digital ABM Manager, Dialpad One key initiative: Testing messaging and creative strategies across Dialpad’s product lines. Through rigorous A/B testing, they analyzed how different visual elements impacted campaign performance. The team discovered that product UI screenshots increased click-through rates — but only under specific conditions. Visuals needed adequate space to display properly and had to directly reinforce the ad message to drive engagement.   These insights led to the development of standardized creative templates optimized for 6sense ad campaigns. “Now we have data-backed guidelines for our design team,” says Shanelle. “We know exactly when and how to use visuals to maximize performance.”   The results Beyond campaign performance, working with Professional Services delivered broader benefits for Dialpad:   Accelerated platform expertise through direct access to 6sense advertising specialists  Increased bandwidth for strategic initiatives by offloading campaign management  Faster optimization cycles through weekly collaborative review sessions  Ultimately, Dialpad gained direct access to platform advertising expertise while maintaining the strategic alignment that comes from working with internal experts. The results? Between Q3 and Q4 2023, Dialpad saw a 17% reduction in cost-per-click and 41% increase in influenced form fills.    The ongoing collaboration continues to uncover new opportunities for optimization.    “Every decision we make is truly collaborative,” Rauli Garcia, 6sense’s VP of Strategic Consulting and Analytics, says. “We’re constantly analyzing performance data and testing new approaches to improve results. It’s about building a foundation for long-term success, not just managing campaigns.” "
https://6sense.com/customer-stories/reltio-saves-1098-hours-of-bdr-time-with-6senses-ai-email-assistant/	Reltio	Medium	information technology and services	"Reltio, a leader in data unification and management, previously faced the all-too-common industry challenge—having to do more with less.  Knowing that chasing lukewarm opportunities isn’t the most effective use of most business development representatives’ (BDRs) time, Reltio turned to 6sense’s AI’s Email Agents for support.   This case study dives deep into Reltio’s Email Agents strategy that saved 1,098 hours of BDR time, and helped them earn the ‘Efficiency Experts’ award at Breakthrough 2024.   The challenge Reltio faced several interconnected challenges in their sales and marketing processes, each contributing to inefficiencies:   Limited BDR capacity: The need to increase productivity without expanding the team.  Inefficient follow-ups: BDRs were spending time chasing unresponsive accounts. Sales readiness assessment: Difficulty in properly assessing prospect readiness within a 60-day timeframe.  Funnel optimization: The need to improve conversion rates and increase velocity through the sales funnel.  Resource allocation: Balancing “speed-to-lead” initiatives with buyer-intent signal-based prospecting.  With over 6,000 accounts to manage and ambitious business targets, Reltio needed a strategy that could deliver higher quality opportunities through a re-architected funnel.   The solution Reltio implemented 6sense’s comprehensive Email Agents, which automate and personalize email outreach using artificial intelligence. Email Agents operate 24/7, provide fast follow-up, and route accounts to BDRs at appropriate stages.    Importantly, BDRs collaborate with Email Agents, contributing their own knowledge and context to ensure targeted approaches. This collaboration allows BDRs to handle about 20% of the work, while the AI manages the rest, striking an effective balance between human expertise and AI efficiency.   Reltio’s sophisticated ABX media program shifted the team’s focus from individual marketing qualified leads to buying groups within a 60-day timeframe. Using 6sense, they:    Created account segments for key industries and different funnel stages  Matched these segments with Salesforce data  Dynamically updated the segments based on intent signals  Pushed the segments into display campaigns on LinkedIn and 6sense ad platforms   Campaigns were created to harness these segments and deliver specific messaging based on  persona, geography, industry, intent, and stage in the sales funnel.   Ultimately, for Reltio, the key to operationalizing Email Agents at scale lies in how it integrates Email Agents with its go to market systems, reinforces its ABX principles, and aligns behaviors with incentives.  “We are doing more with less. As we review the data and refine our processes, we become more intelligent about our use-cases for the AI email writer.”  Michael Brown Head of Global Business Development, Reltio The Results Reltio effectively doubled their BDR capacity without adding headcount. They created a well-structured, efficient, and scalable ABX model and paid media strategy that positioned them for continued growth.

https://6sense.com/customer-stories/how-dremio-boosted-google-ads-pipeline-by-90-with-6sense-integration/	Dremio		information technology and services	"Dremio, the data lakehouse platform for self-service analytics and AI, is seeing a big increase in demand for data products like theirs.     A big part of their growth strategy involves 6sense and search engine marketing. According to a 2022 study by Bain, search engines are the most used source in the B2B buying process (used by 84% of B2B buyers). If you are not in a top 3 organic position on an important search term, then you need to supplement with paid search. The top 3 organic positions capture 2/3 of all organic traffic.   Dremio was driving leads through Google Ads but they weren’t converting to pipeline to justify the level of spend. By integrating 6sense with Google products, pipeline driven through Google Ads increased by 90% and sales qualified opportunities by 115% in just two quarters.   Their digital agency, Lionhurst, will walk you through the steps that they took to integrate 6sense with Google products.   The challenges Before the 6sense integration was set up, Dremio was optimizing Google Ads to form completions. This was problematic because only a small percentage of visitors submitted a form. The average conversion rate for nonbrand search on B2B forms is between 1 – 3%. By only optimizing to those conversions, companies starve Google of the data that it needs to make accurate bidding decisions.   “Dremio was in a great position since it had a 6sense model that had been trained with over 2 years of intent data and pipeline generation. This was a valuable asset that had been underutilized for ad targeting. Since Jim and his team at Lionhurst integrated 6sense to align our bidding to best fit customers, Paid Search has quickly become our top performing digital marketing channel for quality pipeline.”  Whit Rothe Director of Growth, Dremio For Google Ads to run efficiently, it requires a high quantity of accurate performance data. This is because most larger companies use Smart Bidding, which allows Google to set the bid for every search auction in relation to the goals of the account. The set bid is based on the expected performance of that user when they reach the site.    If Google doesn’t have conversion information on 98% of clicks, it will not be able to set accurate bids. When bids in an account have a spread of $0.50 – $100, it’s important to get it right. 6sense helps provide more and better conversion data. Google Ads also lacks firmographic targeting. B2B advertising is about more than just finding people interested in your solution, it’s about finding these people who work at the right companies. Many firmographic attributes that you can use to build segments in 6sense do not exist in Google Ads.    The solution Dremio was able to overcome these challenges by integrating 6sense with Google products. The first step is to set up the 6sense webtag to integrate with Google Tag Manager by pushing the 6sense firmographic and predictive attributes to the data layer. After this is complete, these attributes can be sent over to Google Analytics and be used to enrich custom explorations (full instructions).   Google Analytics Google Analytics becomes a much more powerful platform when enriched with 6sense firmographic data. This allows you to see every identifiable company that completes a certain action on site, such as a demo or page view. In addition, you can see how qualified these companies are by leveraging profile and intent score:   (GA4 exploration of companies that have signed up for demos, using three new fields from 6sense)   The other useful feature of Google Analytics is to build audiences and segments based on 6sense segments. This allows these audiences to be synced to Google for targeting or bidding purposes. A few tactics that you can use these audiences for:   Retarget YouTube and Display ads to specific 6sense segments (e.g., visitors that match your Ideal Customer Profile)  Target an expanded set of searches if a user is in a valuable 6sense segment  Prevent low quality visitors from clicking Google ads in the future  (GA4 audience built using 6sense segments and predictive attributes)   Google Ads The most impactful way to leverage 6sense with Google Ads is via your measurement strategy. Your measurement strategy dictates how effectively Google is able to set bids, which directly correlates to ROI. This integration solves the biggest issue with measurement for B2B: a lack of data.   You can increase data quantity by:   Tracking conversions from ICP visits: Measure which clicks are from your ICP, then use those signals to ask to Google to drive more of them! This will also allow you to see which keywords drive the most ICP traffic.  Tracking conversions based on buying stage: If you feel that a certain buying stage is more valuable to drive to the site (e.g., decision) then you could track those visits as conversions.  Increase data quality by:   Using profile scores for dynamic conversion values: Not all demos are worth the same to the business. A demo signup from a prospect with a 6sense Profile Score of 99 is more valuable than a demo signup from a prospect with a Profile Score of 2. Incorporate profile score into the conversion value using Google Tag Manager.  Increase bids for valuable audiences: Use Conversion Value rules for top audiences, like ICP. This will tell Google to spend more on auctions for these visitors.  Implementing these strategies led to a decrease in total leads through Google Ads, however pipeline driven through Google Ads increased by 90% and sales qualified opportunities by 115% in just two quarters.

https://6sense.com/customer-stories/revolutionizing-abx-strategy-jaggaers-journey-with-6sense-and-2x/	JAGGAER	Large	computer software	"JAGGAER, a world leader in procurement software, faced a common problem in the B2B industry: making their Account-Based Experiences (ABX) strategy work its best with limited resources. Despite being a sizable organization, resource allocation constrained their ABX efforts in North America.  Annika Helmrich, Vice President of Growth Marketing at JAGGAER, recognized the need for a more sophisticated approach to ABX. While the company had implemented 6sense, low adoption by sales and marketing teams kept its data-driven insights from having a full impact. Annika saw an opportunity to transform their ABX efforts and drive significant improvements in efficiency and results.  The challenge: Scaling ABX with limited resources Before optimizing with 6sense, JAGGAER faced several significant challenges hindering ABX effectiveness:  Low platform adoption: Despite having 6sense, the platform lacked traction across the sales and marketing organizations, limiting its potential impact. Resource constraints: The company had set ambitious targets for 2024, which their small team was struggling to support effectively. Inefficient legacy processes: JAGGAER’s existing ABX processes were low-tech and no longer sufficient to meet their evolving needs, causing inefficiency. Need for process optimization: There was a pressing need to streamline processes and deliver more impactful results to justify the investment in ABX. “Despite having a marketing team of around 50, our ABX team in North America consisted of just two professionals who were already at full capacity. We needed to maximize efficiency and effectiveness in managing our ABX tech stack, but lacked the internal bandwidth to audit and improve our processes.”  Annika Helmrich VP of Growth Marketing, JAGGAER The solution: Partnering with 6sense and 2X for comprehensive ABX optimization To address these challenges, JAGGAER turned to 6sense and their Teal-Level Services Partner, 2X, to rework their ABM strategy. The solution involved several key components:  Optimized 6sense implementation: 2X brought its 6sense platform expertise and certified marketing-as-a-service team to work as an extension of JAGGAER’s team. This provided the necessary bandwidth to orchestrate a program that included everything from account segmentation to real-time intent-driven outreach. Integrated tech stack: 6sense was integrated with existing technologies, including Folloze, Salesforce CRM, Pardot, Outreach, Qualified webchat, Google Analytics and Looker Studio. AI-driven account scoring: 6sense’s Predictive Analytics model was implemented for automatic scoring of hot accounts in-market. Automated routing: 6sense Intelligent Workflows were set up to dynamically segment audiences based on account behavior, and to route qualified accounts to the appropriate sales reps. Targeted advertising: Dynamic audience segments were used for better ad budget optimization. Web personalization at Scale: 6sense was integrated with Folloze to deliver tailored website content experiences. Custom ABX reporting dashboard: 2X built a comprehensive, real-time campaign outcomes dashboard using Looker Studio. Ongoing ABM program management: 2X assisted with efficiently building and running ABX programs on the platform, providing continuous support and optimization. “The combination of 6sense and their service partner, 2X, has been a game-changer for our ABX strategy. Despite having a small team, we can now execute campaigns with greater precision and achieve remarkable results,”  Annika Helmrich VP of Growth Marketing, JAGGAER The results: Rapid transformation and significant cost savings JAGGAER’s increased adoption of 6sense’s automation features, combined with the expertise provided by 2X, led to significant improvements in their ABX strategy:  Increased efficiency: Annika’s small in-house team can now manage ABX efforts more effectively, using automation and advanced analytics to optimize campaigns. Cost savings: JAGGAER saved $77,459 in just the first two months compared to the cost of hiring local in-house resources. Faster time to value: Within two months of launching their optimized campaigns (starting March 20th), JAGGAER achieved impressive results: 147 unique accounts engaged 129 accounts reached 6QA status and moved to SDR sequences 11 accounts opened opportunities Seamless integrations: The unified approach to marketing strategy, facilitated by 2X’s integration work, enhanced overall performance across JAGGAER’s tech stack. Real-time performance insights: The custom business intelligence dashboard built by 2X empowered the marketing team to make data-driven decisions, and to clearly demonstrate the impact of marketing efforts. Lower Cost per qualified opportunity: JAGGAER experienced an overall decrease in the cost to generate qualified opportunities compared to their pre-6sense and 2X engagement period. Looking ahead: A new era of data-driven ABX at JAGGAER With their revitalized ABX strategy powered by 6sense and supported by 2X, JAGGAER is well-positioned for continued growth. The combination of advanced technology and expert support has addressed their immediate challenges and set the stage for long-term success.   As they move forward, JAGGAER can use their new capabilities to maintain their competitive edge in the procurement software market and drive sustainable growth."
https://6sense.com/customer-stories/how-firemon-optimizes-multi-channel-campaigns-with-6sense-audience-workflows/	FireMon		computer & network security	"When Taylor Allewelt joined FireMon as an account-based marketing manager, she discovered an untapped goldmine: the company’s 6sense instance wasn’t being used to its full potential. Together with Amy Yuan, director of marketing operations, they saw an opportunity to transform FireMon’s marketing approach.    Now that the company, a leader in network security policy management, had the support — along with a vision for maximizing their marketing technology — they were ready to pivot to a focused account-based strategy with 6sense. But first, they needed to address a few challenges.     The challenge Along with the underused 6sense platform, prior to 2024, FireMon’s marketing strategy was broad, targeting SBM, midsize, and enterprise markets without a cohesive approach. The company struggled with:   Lack of alignment between sales and marketing teams  Inefficient use of their extensive martech stack  Limited ability to nurture leads through multi-channel marketing  Difficulty in identifying and engaging high-intent accounts  “Prior to 6sense, we used a one-size-fits-all approach for our campaigns, treating all prospects the same regardless of their buying stage. We showed them a single message and hoped for engagement,” Amy explains.    Taylor adds that they needed support automating the buyer’s journey throughout the funnel. She says, “We were running simple plays but wanted to run a complicated play. We wanted to mimic how the buyers ingest their information. We knew 6sense could help us do that.”    The solution FireMon implemented a comprehensive ABX strategy using 6sense’s capabilities, starting with an audit of their existing 6sense instance. As Taylor explains, “I looked at our taxonomy, our ICP account formula, making sure we’re seeing the same thing from our Salesforce that we are in 6sense.” This laid the groundwork for a more effective use of the platform.    In Q3 of 2024, FireMon began using 6sense’s Intelligent Workflows – Audience feature, which is currently in beta and launching in Q1 of 2025. Intelligent Workflows has become a central part of FireMon’s strategy because it streamlines data management and omni-channel engagement with automated workflows.    “Intelligent Workflows enables us to automate intricate, full-funnel buyer journeys with ease. This powerful multi-channel automation platform drives our digital, email, and social marketing campaigns by leveraging audience intent signals. It nurtures leads through their ideal, complex buyer journeys, allowing marketing to effectively warm up prospects before seamlessly handing them off to our sales team.”  Taylor Allewelt Sr. ABM Manager Intelligent Workflows – Audience allows teams to manage dynamic audiences across various channels like display, social, CRM, MAP, and email all on a single canvas within the 6sense ABM platform. FireMon has also integrated 6sense with other key platforms in their tech stack, including Marketo, Salesforce, and Google Ads.   “Intelligent Workflows is the only tool I’ve encountered that truly provides us with a visual way to bring everything together,” Amy says.   The tool has enabled the team to nurture leads more effectively, expanding beyond basic email campaigns to incorporate digital advertising and other touchpoints tailored to the buyer’s stage – a true omni-channel buyer’s journey.  FireMon has already experienced the impact of being able to create streamlined, hyper-personalized campaigns within Intelligent Workflows.    “Because of Intelligent Workflows, we’re able to meet our buyers where they’re at. We can give them relevant messaging and content suggestions. As a result, we’ve been able to see a 50% increase in buyers’ engagement behaviors,” Taylor says.    Another key component involves 6sense’s contact acquisition program, which helped to fill the gap left by a reduced SDR team and enabled marketing to take a more active role in prospecting and lead nurturing.    Accelerating growth with professional services  FireMon rolled out 6sense Revenue AI for Sales simultaneously with Intelligent Workflows. Since implementing two new tools at once can be time-consuming, FireMon received support from a 6sense professional services expert.  Taylor says, “Having professional services help us implement Sales Intelligence allowed me to focus more of my time on the Intelligent Workflows rollout.”   For FireMon, 6sense Professional Services provided expertise in five key areas:   Project Planning and Support: Provided a structured plan for the rollout, ensuring a clear timeline and actionable steps. Securing Executive Buy-In: Prepared and presented slide decks tailored to the executive team, highlighting the benefits and strategic value of the SI enterprise solution. Training and Onboarding: Conducted comprehensive training sessions for the sales team, ensuring they were well-versed in using the new tool. Driving Adoption: Incentivized the sales team to complete their sales certifications with a SPIFF program that was instrumental in driving adoption and ensuring that 10 sales team members were certified. Sales Leadership Engagement: Sales leadership actively adopted and promoted the tool, integrating it into their daily and monthly metrics. This top-down support was crucial in maintaining ongoing engagement and utilization of the SI enterprise solution. Working with 6sense Professional Services allowed FireMon to roll out Sales Intelligence in just one month, cutting launch time in half. Additionally, FireMon has seen a 100% daily login rate among sellers and steady levels of daily activity.   “Having internal support from 6sense took pressure off of me to learn a new tool and present it to executives. Support from our 6sense expert accelerated our executives’ knowledge of the tool which then accelerated the purchase of the solution,” Taylor says.   The results FireMon’s 6sense display ads, which are part of a retargeting nurture program integrated with Intelligent Workflows, stand as their top-performing 6sense campaign. This campaign generates twice the impressions compared to others targeting a similar audience size, achieving an impressive click-through rate (CTR) of 34%. This metric is significantly higher than the typical CTR range of 7-14% observed in similar flows.    By aligning marketing and sales efforts through shared use of 6sense data, FireMon successfully transitioned to an ABX strategy, aligning sales and marketing efforts and creating more targeted, efficient campaigns based on intent data and buyer stage.    FireMon has seen significant impact with 6sense, such as:   Enhanced engagement impressions, and CTRs across campaigns powered by Intelligent Workflows, Accelerated launch timelines for complex multi-channel workflows,  Strengthened collaboration between RevOps, ABM, and GTM teams for seamless alignment,  Positive impact on sales outcomes and,  Expanding reach within ICP accounts through Intelligent Workflows-driven ABM campaigns.  “During Covid up until the start of last year we wanted to leverage the best in class tools for our RevOps and MarTech stacks but we found we never used everything to its full capacity. That’s why we did a RevOps and MarTech consolidation in 2024 and the decision to make 6sense a core platform we use to its full potential has already made a substantial impact,” Joey Saucedo, FireMon’s GTM chief of staff, says.   The streamlined approach has fostered unprecedented collaboration across teams, with the platform serving as the central hub for their marketing and sales initiatives.   “6sense is like the glue that keeps us together,” Taylor concludes.
