Corporate Sales Development	Enterprise (> 1000 emp.)	8/1/2025	Strengths:	Technical Frustrations:	Having accurate information on prospects to make sure I'm speaking to the correct person.
Business Development Representative	Mid-Market (51-1000 emp.)	8/1/2025	"The 6QA system is very innovate, allowing insights into prospect activities that are re;evant to you. In addition, the integration into SalesForce is a good tool as well, I actually use this tool quite often! 6Sense is fairly well rounded when it comes to the different abilities it has."	"When the 6QA's come in, the fact that it's so broad, the amount of research required to get remotely close to the bottom of who was doing  the actual activity or searched up those keywords, just to end up at the wrong person, is unsettling to say the least lol Too much time required for little reward. And then the accuracy of the SF tool could be much more precise. Additionally, the website could be far easier to use. It's not very user friendly at the moment."	6Sense solves the manual research required for prospecting individuals and it benefits me greatly by cutting down the prospecting time as a whole.
Account Development Executive	Enterprise (> 1000 emp.)	7/30/2025	"What I appreciate most is 6sense ability to automatically bring up accounts in the buying phase, even those that we wouldn't have targeted manually. The interface is clear, the alerts are relevant, and it gives a real boost to the ABM strategy. It saves precious time in identifying active accounts, enabling intelligent prioritization and a higher conversion rate."	"The wealth of data can sometimes be a little dense at first: it takes a little time to get used to all the features. More customization of certain alerts would be useful, notably to avoid duplicates or further refine relevance. Nothing blocking, but a few UX improvements would make the experience even smoother."	"6sense helps us identify accounts that are really in the active research phase, enabling us to concentrate our prospecting efforts on the right targets at the right time. This drastically reduces the time spent on manual qualification, and improves the relevance of campaigns. This translates into better conversions and a much more strategic approach on the sales side."
Sales development representative	Enterprise (> 1000 emp.)	7/29/2025	"It has most numbers for the prospects i go after. It also flags in‑market intent so I know who to call first. The integrations with our CRM and sequencing tools let me push accounts into cadences quickly. Direct dials are accurate more often than not, though there are gaps for smaller or newer companies. Overall, it cuts my research time and noticeably improves connect and meeting rates."	"That said, in my segment the info was outdated more often than not. I frequently hit stale titles, departed contacts, or reassigned direct dials—especially at fast‑growing companies. Even intent signals sometimes lagged, so “in‑market” accounts had cooled by the time I reached out. I found myself cross‑checking in LinkedIn and Apollo, which slowed me down; clearer “last‑verified” dates and faster refresh cycles would help."	"It is solving giving me the prospect information this is crucial in my SDR role, as i need to contact by email and phone number these prospects"
Associate Account Executive	Mid-Market (51-1000 emp.)	7/29/2025	"What I like best about 6sense Sales Intelligence is its ability to provide deep, data-driven insights that help identify the right buyers at the right time. The platform’s AI-powered predictive analytics and intent data allow sales teams to prioritize accounts with high buying intent, personalize outreach effectively, and ultimately shorten the sales cycle. It’s a powerful tool for improving targeting and increasing conversion rates."	"One potential downside of 6sense Sales Intelligence is that the platform can have a steep learning curve for new users due to its rich features and data complexity. Also, sometimes the volume of data and alerts can feel overwhelming, requiring teams to fine-tune settings to avoid noise and focus on the most relevant insights. However, with proper onboarding and customization, these challenges can be managed effectively."	"6sense Sales Intelligence solves the problem of identifying and prioritizing high-potential prospects by leveraging AI-driven predictive analytics and intent data. This helps sales teams focus their efforts on accounts that are actively in-market, reducing wasted time on low-priority leads. For me, this means more efficient outreach, better alignment with buyer needs, and ultimately higher conversion rates and faster sales cycles."
Outboud Business Development Representative	Enterprise (> 1000 emp.)	7/29/2025	"6Sense gives clear visibility into which accounts are actively researching our solution, making it easier to prioritize outreach and personalize messaging. The intent data and buying stage insights are incredibly helpful for knowing when to engage and what to say. It’s been a game changer for targeting the right people at the right time."	"While the intent data is valuable, it can sometimes be difficult to validate the accuracy or understand the full context behind certain signals. The platform also has a bit of a learning curve at first especially when it comes to customizing filters and interpreting buyer stage data across different segments. A bit more clarity or training resources around those areas would be helpful."	"6sense helps solve the challenge of identifying which accounts are actually in-market and ready to engage. Instead of cold outreach, I can prioritize high-intent accounts, tailor my messaging based on their behavior, and time my outreach when they’re most likely to respond."
	Enterprise (> 1000 emp.)	7/29/2025	The ability to see what organization has been looking at certain items based on the key words has allowed me to narrow down whom within an organization I am searching for. Having the key titles and personas available in one spot is also a time saver.	I have not found really anything that I dislike about the intelligence of the system at this time.	I have been spending less time researching as I have the ability to see what key words are being searched which allows me to target certain groups/departments and the ability to have the personas in one spot to look at is also a huge time saver. Having lists already set up for the territories I cover and being able to log in every day with an update is very helpful.
	Enterprise (> 1000 emp.)	7/29/2025	"It's a very solid product that mixes contact acquisition and intent signals. The business development role is hard already so getting any possible edge over other competitors. The data is quite accurate but I haven't found a tool that has 85% accuracy or greater. 6Sense has now, in my opinion, edged out ZoomInfo and Lusha."	"Like other contact acquisition tools, you cannot trust the data completely. I have had to supplement 6Sense by manual prospecting with LinkedIn. It's also frustrating that we cannot track intent down to the specific contact, but I understand from a data privacy perspective."	"Ultimately, I've been using 6Sense as a contact acquisition tool. However, the intent signals have been very impactful in ensuring that I am not ""spraying and praying"" but rather creating targeted lists and sending contacts hyper relevant messaging."
	Enterprise (> 1000 emp.)	7/29/2025	"I really like that it shares where the person who went on the website lives so you can find the person based on their location to reach out. I also appreciate the keywords searched and the personal information (phone #, email) you can see. I check it every day and appreciate the hot new accounts."	"I find that a majority of the accounts listed as hot are existing customers. As someone who only deals with net new accounts, I would love to be able to see an accurate list of only non-customers. It makes sense a current customer would be looking up info on our company, I just want to be able to see prospects. I think if it integrated better with our salesforce instance, I would be far more inclined to recommend it to someone. It's full of duplicate records and existing customers."	"It's solving the problem of not being able to tell if a company is actually interested or not. This shows which accounts are actually looking up relevant keywords, which people I should reach out to, and what they're looking at. In that regard, it's very helpful. It also sometimes provides more accurate phone numbers than the other services my company uses and I find that the phone numbers are especially accurate and helpful."
	Enterprise (> 1000 emp.)	7/30/2025	I like that 6sense provides strong intent data and visibility into where accounts are in the buying journey. The platform’s ability to show which companies are actively researching relevant topics can help prioritize outreach.	"I find the contact data coverage and accuracy to be more limited compared to other tools like ZoomInfo. The user interface can feel less intuitive, which makes it harder to find the right contacts or insights quickly. The platform can sometimes feel overly complex for basic prospecting needs, requiring more clicks to get to actionable information."	"6sense helps identify which accounts are actively showing buying intent, which allows me to focus my time on prospects who are more likely to engage. It also gives insight into where accounts are in the buyer’s journey, helping me tailor my outreach more effectively. This prioritization can be useful for driving higher-quality conversations and improving overall pipeline efficiency."
"Sr Manager - Digital Marketing, Programs"	Enterprise (> 1000 emp.)	8/7/2025	"6sense is a top-tier platform for any B2B organization committed to an account-based strategy. Its powerful blend of AI-driven insights, cross-functional alignment, and streamlined automation makes it a must-have for those looking to achieve predictable and sustainable revenue growth."	"Reporting in 6sense often feels too rigid. As a user, I want the flexibility to build highly specific, custom reports that align with my unique business metrics, not just what's provided out-of-the-box. This is a critical need for analyzing long-term performance and truly assessing the effectiveness of campaigns. While the native reports offer a good starting point, they can't always tell the full story, making it difficult to get a complete, customized view of our revenue marketing efforts."	"6sense's automated workflows are not just about saving time; they're about working smarter. They provide the intelligence and automation needed to move from a reactive, guesswork-based approach to a proactive, predictable, and highly efficient revenue marketing engine."
"Senior Manager, Integrated Campaigns"	Mid-Market (51-1000 emp.)	8/6/2025	"I really like the new 6sense Workflows capabilities. We’re currently using it to pilot a pipeline acceleration campaign, and it gives us the ability to get very granular with ad timing, including when ads should be served and for how long. It also allows us to layer in perspective filter data, which adds another level of precision."	"I wish there were more syncs available, and so far I haven’t been overly impressed with the level of detail in the Workflow reporting. On the targeting side, while it's great to get really specific, you have to be very diligent with country data. If I target a company like ABC, it defaults to the global domain unless I apply additional filters, which can be frustrating when trying to focus on a specific region."	It's helping us scale a global pipeline acceleration campaign by enabling us to reach a global audience at scale while managing execution at a very granular level. We've also successfully deployed display ads with the goal of driving brand awareness in key markets.
"VP, Digital Marketing"	Enterprise (> 1000 emp.)	8/6/2025	"6sense has been a helpful tool in prioritizing accounts and aligning sales and marketing efforts. The intent data is solid and gives us a clearer picture of which accounts are showing buying signals, allowing for more strategic outreach and campaign targeting. The platform also integrates well with our CRM and MAP, which helps streamline workflows and reporting. The UI is clean and has improved over time, and customer success is very responsive and willing to help troubleshoot when issues arise."	"There’s a learning curve, especially for teams new to ABM or predictive tools. Some of the functionality, like segments and journeys, can be difficult to fully leverage without heavy support or training."	"6sense is helping us solve the challenge of identifying and prioritizing in-market accounts earlier in the buyer journey. Before 6sense, our sales and marketing teams often worked off limited data or gut instinct when targeting accounts. Now, we’re able to focus efforts on companies that are actively showing intent, which improves alignment and efficiency across teams."
Global Account-Based Marketing Manager	Enterprise (> 1000 emp.)	8/6/2025	"What I like the most about 6sense Revenue Marketing is its ability to bring together account intent data, predictive scoring, marketing activity, and contact engagement insights in a single platform. It gives us clear visibility into where accounts are in the buying journey, enabling us to orchestrate effective full-funnel campaigns across channels—greatly improving alignment between marketing and sales/BDRs. The platform also makes it easy to build highly targeted custom audiences using 6sense intent signals, including specific keyword topics, which we can seamlessly sync to LinkedIn and other channels for precise targeting. Additionally, the support we’ve received—both through the ticketing system and from our dedicated CSM—has been outstanding. They’re responsive, proactive in sharing feature updates, and consistently provide strategic guidance."	"The reporting capabilities, particularly around marketing influence and 6sense-driven impact, are not reliable enough for actionable use. More robust and accurate reporting would greatly improve collaboration with sales teams. Additionally, there’s a significant learning curve, which has made it challenging to drive adoption among sales users. A more structured and thorough implementation process could help ensure better alignment and usage across teams. Lastly, deeper integration with Pardot—especially for features like data enrichment and Smart-Form Fill—would enhance overall effectiveness and streamline workflows."	"6sense Revenue Marketing helps us better understand account and buyer intent, as well as where prospects are in the funnel. This insight has significantly improved our ROI and strengthened our campaign performance. With 6sense, we can run and manage multiple ad campaigns more efficiently while gaining clearer visibility into how Marketing is engaging and nurturing key accounts in alignment with Sales."
PPC leader	Enterprise (> 1000 emp.)	7/22/2025	"6sense makes it easy to identify in-market accounts and engage them at the right time with the right messaging. I use it regularly to prioritize outreach and align with sales. The platform offers a wide range of features, and the integrations with our CRM and marketing tools are smooth. Their customer support is also very responsive and helpful whenever questions come up."	"The interface can feel a bit complex at first, especially during implementation. There are many features to explore, so it takes time to become fully confident using everything. However, once set up, the overall experience is efficient and valuable."	"6sense helps solve the challenge of targeting the right accounts at the right time. Before using it, we had limited visibility into buying intent and often relied on guesswork for prioritization. Now, we can focus on accounts that are actually showing interest, which has improved efficiency across both marketing and sales. It also reduces wasted spend and increases the relevance of our campaigns, leading to better engagement and pipeline impact."
Senior RevOps Analyst	Mid-Market (51-1000 emp.)	7/21/2025	"6sense helps us see which companies are actually showing interest in what we offer. This makes it easier for our marketing and sales teams to know who to focus on and when to reach out. We can also build better-targeted campaigns based on what people are looking at. Overall, it helps us spend our time on the right accounts and get better results."	"Sometimes the platform can feel a bit complex and takes time to fully understand. The user interface isn’t always intuitive, especially for new users. Also, some of the data syncs or integrations can lag or require extra troubleshooting."	"6sense Revenue Marketing helps solve the problem of identifying and prioritizing in-market accounts that are actively researching solutions like ours but may not have engaged with us yet. It provides intent signals and buying stage predictions, which allows our sales and marketing teams to focus their efforts on high-potential accounts. This leads to better alignment across teams, more personalized outreach, and ultimately, higher conversion rates and pipeline efficiency."
Global Campaign and Account Based Marketing Manager	Mid-Market (51-1000 emp.)	7/18/2025	"What I like best about 6sense Revenue Marketing for our team is how it helps us see which labs and companies are actually in-market for our instruments and services. Instead of chasing cold leads, our sales and marketing teams can focus on accounts that show real buying intent. The platform uncovers which research organizations are researching topics related to our products, so we can reach out at the right time with relevant information. It also brings marketing and sales onto the same page by highlighting the accounts most likely to convert. This means we spend less time guessing and more time engaging the right prospects."	"One thing I dislike about 6sense Revenue Marketing is that some of its features are complex. The platform offers a lot of tools and data, which can feel overwhelming at first. It takes time to learn how to use all the features effectively. Some users may find the interface confusing until they get more experience with it. This learning curve can slow down adoption, especially for team members who are new to intent data or account-based marketing platforms."	"6sense Revenue Marketing helps solve the problem of wasted effort on accounts that are not ready to buy. It shows us which companies are actually in the market for our products, so we know where to focus our time. This reduces time spent on cold outreach and improves our chances of talking to the right prospects at the right moment."
MarTech and Automation Team Lead	Small-Business (50 or fewer emp.)	7/8/2025	Detailed Insights into Intent and ability to segment based on funnel stage and engagement. The ability to take this insights an manage campaigns accross multiple platforms for advertising is easy wihtin the apltform which provides good oversights of the adience management. Being able to enrich contacts and accounts using the integrations with CRM and MAP platforms brings additionalv alue to the marketing team. Integrations are expansive and with the additional API connectors can be apllied to non native connections easily enough. Configurtation of elements such as Sales Intelligence is quick and only requires admin access meaning the implementation of a connected platform is relatively straight forward. The overall solution provides a platform whcih becomes part of the daily routine for Marketers.	The site can be very slow and time can be consumed using the site due to this. Useful information such as  keywords searched are not easily identifiable and require additional digging within the platform. Some of the reporting can be unclear and accounts can show intent without it being directly obvious what the intent is about.	"The platform is identifying the portential accounts and enriching our CRM with enough information to make informed marketing decisions regarding messaging and nurturing. Utilising indistry and fit with ICP and Target Account Lists we can focus a messsage relevant to the buying stage of an account. Providing insights and a clear map of marketing touch points accross the entire buyer journey, Allowing our organisation to develop a strong brand strategy to target accounts not currently identified as being in market so as to increase awareness of solutions and services avilable and help to increase the chance we are high in the supplier options when the organisation enters the buyer journey."
	Mid-Market (51-1000 emp.)	6/27/2025	"What I like best about 6sense Revenue Marketing is how it empowers marketing and sales teams with actionable insights across the entire buyer journey. Its ability to uncover hidden demand, identify in-market accounts, and prioritize the right prospects makes it far easier to focus efforts where they’ll have the greatest impact. The AI-driven predictions, intent data, and real-time engagement tracking help drive smarter, more personalized campaigns, ensuring alignment between sales and marketing while accelerating pipeline growth. Overall, it transforms how teams target, engage, and convert prospects with precision."	"What I dislike about 6sense Revenue Marketing is that while it offers powerful insights and capabilities, the platform can feel complex and overwhelming at first, especially for teams without dedicated resources for setup and ongoing optimization. The learning curve to fully leverage all features—like custom segments, intent models, and advanced integrations—can be steep. Additionally, the pricing structure may be challenging for smaller organizations, and occasional data accuracy or syncing issues with connected systems can require extra monitoring to ensure everything runs smoothly."	"6sense Revenue Marketing is solving the problem of wasted time and effort on accounts that aren’t ready to buy by providing clear visibility into which companies are actively in-market and showing intent. It helps overcome the challenge of aligning marketing and sales by delivering shared data and insights, so both teams can prioritize the right accounts and engage them at the right time with relevant messaging. This has benefited us by increasing efficiency across the revenue team, improving conversion rates, and accelerating pipeline growth, as we can focus our resources on high-potential opportunities rather than guessing where to direct our efforts."
"Sr, manager marketing operations"	Mid-Market (51-1000 emp.)	7/29/2025	"I like how 6sense Revenue Marketing combines account intent data, predictive scoring, and engagement insights into one platform. The ability to see exactly where accounts are in the buying stage and orchestrate campaigns across channels has been a game changer for aligning marketing and sales."	"The buyer stage predictions are extremely valuable, but at times they can be off for niche industries or very small target segments. More transparency into how those stages are calculated would help us fine-tune our targeting."	"6sense helps us identify in-market accounts early by surfacing intent signals we wouldn’t have otherwise seen. This allows our marketing and sales teams to prioritize the right accounts at the right time, improving outreach efficiency and increasing conversion rates."
