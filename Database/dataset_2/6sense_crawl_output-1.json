      "92% of companies say ABM delivers higher ROI than any other marketing approach. So why do many ABM campaigns struggle to move the needle? The answer lies in a fundamental misunderstanding. Most B2B organizations think they’re running ABM campaigns when they’re really just doing lead generation with fancier targeting. They cast a slightly smaller net, […]",
      "The B2B buying process has fundamentally changed.

      "By partnering with 6sense to shift their revenue team strategy, Sage brought forward:",
      "The Challenge | Before 6sense — and before adopting an account engagement strategy — Sage applied similar sales and marketing tactics to both their small and medium business segments.",
      "The marketing team did their best to incorporate targeting strategies, but primarily they were running the same campaigns with the same messaging across the board.",
      "The sales team would follow up as leads came into the organization, but they were not capturing the right audience.",
      "They realized they needed to go back to square one and better understand their total addressable market (TAM) and ideal customer profile (ICP), start personalizing campaigns and outreach, and prioritize the right prospects at the right time.",
      "Looking for the Right Fit | An ideal platform for Sage would help marketing identify accounts showing first- and third-party intent in order to run targeted campaigns that helped push them through the funnel.",
      "Capturing intent signals was also important to allow sales prioritize their efforts on the right accounts, increase the number of opportunities, and ultimately close more deals.",
      "Targeted Marketing | With the ability to dynamically segment and target specific accounts, Sage’s marketing team gained complete visibility into their TAM and ICP.",
      "That prompted the team to develop specific content tracks for different vertical markets. They leveraged the 6sense Company Details API to create dynamic, personalized landing pages on the Sage website with specific, targeted content.",
      "The Sage marketing team used 6sense for display advertising targeted to specific accounts, with relevant messaging across verticals around the benefits of their platform.",
      "They also created stage-based display campaigns that ran across the globe. Their stage-based display ads targeted accounts based on 6sense-predicted buying stage: Awareness, Consideration, Decision, or Purchase.",
      "Shifting Sales Techniques | When 6sense was first deployed, the Sage marketing team spent time with their inbound and outbound sales team to ensure reps had a deep understanding of what intent data really meant.",
      "This allowed them to create a framework around next best actions based on 6sense’s buying stage predictions — a framework that became embedded into their sales process.",
      "On the other end, the Sage team also used 6sense to prioritize accounts showing high levels of intent but that had not yet been engaged. Based on the account’s keyword and intent data, the business development representative (BDR) brainstormed outbound activities in which they could target key personas with personalized content based on what the prospects were researching.",
      "Gaining Confidence | The additional information gave the sales team confidence in their ability to help potential accounts.",
      "Before 6sense, Tasker admitted, the Sage outbound sales team shied away from accounts where there was little background knowledge, as it was difficult to start conversations and immediately provide value.",
      "After 6sense, Tasker explained, “Now, the sales team is able to have ‘warm’ conversations, knowing there’s intent there and the topics the prospect is particularly interested in. It’s made conversations a lot easier, as they can navigate the conversation completely around the prospect’s needs.”",
      "Those techniques worked. Previously, the field sales team was reliant on marketing for leads and opportunities. A year after moving to 6sense, Sage’s sales team opportunity creation increased over 50%.",
      "In a single quarter, they uncovered over 4,000 newly engaged accounts, and over 1,000 accounts with increased engagement — accounts and insights that would not have been uncovered had it not been for 6sense.",
      "Another significant change Tasker mentioned was the increase in credibility and trust in marketing as an organization. With a comprehensive account engagement platform in their hands, the sales team saw that intent data worked, and reaped the benefits by engaging with the right prospects at the right time with the right message, at scale.",
      "The Results | From dipping their toes into ABM to full-blown account engagement across 90% of their global team (and growing), Tasker said, “6sense has been incredibly, intrinsically valuable. It’s a huge win for us. We’ve scaled, we’ve aligned the business around a single go-to-market strategy and the power of 6sense is right in the middle of it all.”",
      "On the bond between sales and marketing, Tasker went on to say, “With 6sense, the trust and relationship between marketing and sales is now a lot stronger — it’s pulled the teams together and they both can see how the other team operates, and they are working together to achieve the same business goals.”",

      "The two marketing leaders further explainhow 6sense tackled initial challenges and continues to empower team alignmentto generate revenue across multiple channels.",
      "The challenge | In 2021, FullStory was using Demandbase and experimenting with ABM for the first time. Sarah, who had just started in an ABM role with FullStory, noticed a few challenges in the go-to-market strategy. Issues included:",
      "“Before 6sense, sales would build their own account list or run their own plays. Then marketing would target a different audience and tell sales.”",
      "FullStory needed a robust platform to support their new ABM plans with persona maps and intent data. 6sense proved the perfect solution for aligning sales and marketing around trusted data, prioritizing in-market accounts based on intent signals, and expanding outreach into enterprise-sized companies.",
      "The solution: Meeting people where they are | In switching from Demandbase to 6sense, FullStory started leveraging intent data to focus on higher-quality leads rather than just quantity alone.",
      "“6sense helped us look more into the quality of leads converting and getting to an opportunity,” Sarah explains.",
      "FullStory used 6senseintent dataandpredictive analyticsto understand potential customers’ buying stage and serve them content relevant to where they are in the buying journey.",
      "“Being able to meet our buyers where they are as they progress through the funnel has allowed us to dynamically tailor our messaging and content to each buying stage, strategically serving up a relevant call-to-action as accounts show stronger in-market signals.”",
      "Now, 6sense functions as the foundation in FullStory’s latest go-to-market strategy, which focuses on three pillars:",
      "Moving upstream into enterprise:Where they were once traditionally focused on small- and mid-market-sized companies, FullStory now leverages 6sense intent data to broaden their reach and tap into the enterprise market to reveal gaps in existing content strategy by persona.",
      "By targeting messaging to multiple members of the buying team — and spotting when more members engage — FullStory knows which accounts are truly in-market and closest to making a purchase decision.",
      "“When reps are leaning into those 6QA accounts, we can show the lift across win rate, deal size, deal velocity, and pipeline created,” Jen explains.",
      "Doubling down on the install base:In their mission to expand and retain current customers, FullStory created custom 6sense dashboards focused on accounts with renewals in the next three to six months. They also use 6sense to track which existing customers are researching competitor terms or shopping around and layer in renewal risks and customer sentiment scores.",
      "Jen says this gives FullStory time to play offense before a customer may churn.",
      "6sense also powers an expansion play by revealing intent topics that enable upselling and cross-selling existing customers.",
      "Optimizing campaigns to increase conversion across the board:FullStory makes the most out of their budget by layering behavioral signals with 6sense.",
      "“Across organizations, every marketer is being asked to be as efficient as possible with their budget,” Jen says. “6sense allows us to double down and be hyper-focused on who we are targeting by leaning into accounts with in-market signals versus our old spray-and-pray approach.”",
      "With 6sense, FullStory knows they are using their budget smartly to focus on the contacts that will give them the highest return on their advertising spend.",
      "The results | 6sense’s usability and actionable insights have been a game-changer for FullStory’s revenue team since switching from Demandbase.",
      "“Being able to tie the data back to tangible business outcomes is crucial. We know it’s not just this fluffy number,” Jen says.",

      "The challenge: No single source of truth | “When I joined in May 2021, the business was split into core Ivanti products and the acquired businesses. It hadn’t been fully integrated,” Carole says.",
      "“Before 6sense — there was no single source of truth on our accounts or contact-level data. Metrics and measurements were difficult because we had multiple platforms.”",
      "The acquisitions also confused customers about Ivanti’s brand, the breadth of their offerings, and overall capabilities.",

      "“I’ve been a fan of 6sense for many years and have implemented the platform in multiple companies.  It delights me when people realize the magic of having your sales and BDR teams work warm leads and stop doing cold outbound!  Higher win rates, higher ASPs and more efficiency in driving revenue.  That’s what you get with 6sense.”",
      "Kacee says as Drata moves up market and targets larger, more enterprise-sized accounts, they knew they needed a tool like 6sense to do that efficiently.",

This results in a target list of accounts that show intent to buy and are a good fit for your product.",

      "Kacee saysone of the most impactful integrations is within LinkedIn, which allows marketers to take account data from 6sense segments and target people on LinkedIn.",

      "Running a sales pilot program | On the sales side, Drata has addressed the need for account prioritization and intelligence with Revenue AI for Sales.",
      "But, achieving success meant going all in on the adoption and enablement of 6sense. So, Drata established a pilot program to guarantee successful adoption.",
      "“Success is all about enablement. Having 6sense doesn’t mean just getting your predictive model up and running. There’s also an element of teaching. We took the approach of having a pilot team of sellers and having them teach their peers how to use 6sense.”",
      "This pilot program, supported by a member of the 6sense team, involved:",
      "This pilot program encouraged widespread adoption of 6sense by sellers. Kacee says, “All Drata sellers take advantage of using the 6sense dashboard on a daily basis. It’s a huge part of their daily workflow.”",

Finally, we taught them how to look at keywords in 6sense so they can use certain words to personalize outreach messages,” Kacee says.",
      "Stronger alignment and results | Drata’s success demonstrates the power of AI-driven tools in driving revenue and alignment. Marketers and sellers have a much clearer picture of who to target, when, and how.",
      "“6sense has sellers and marketers speaking the same language. I think it’s common for marketers and sellers to go after different accounts, with unclear messaging, in the wrong buying stages. 6sense helps bridge that gap so sellers and marketers have a seamless strategy targeting the same accounts.”",
      "“6sense is quickly increasing revenue. If you execute properly, 6sense makes your life easier. We use a lot of different tools to measure intent, but 6sense has actually proven to be stronger than the others. It’s a platform that I trust.

      "Behind KBX’s continuous success is a strong go-to-market strategy supported by tools like 6sense.",
      "Chris Kein, National Business Development at KBX, shares how sellers and marketers use 6sense to target accounts more efficiently and reduce costs, ultimately allowing KBX to expand their services and increase average deal sizes by 504%.",
      "“Our strategy involved a lot of cold calling, a lot of LinkedIn messaging out of the blue. There was minimal strategic thinking on how we’re reaching out or why. We were just hoping to get lucky,” Chris says.",
      "“We basically were just sending emails and tracking everything in Excel. We went through a transformation on how we get serious on helping customers outside of our internal business grow,” Chris explains,” We wanted a tool to help us aggressively pursue business rather than just catch what came to us through internal referral.”",
      "The solution | KBX first implemented Salesforce as their CRM, then added 6sense to support go-to-market processes and an overall ABM strategy.",
      "Chris says they adopted a “crawl-walk-run” approach when first rolling out 6sense. They focused first on building the necessary infrastructure and repeatable processes while testing keyword signals for lead identification. Then, marketers started using 6sense to create relevant content for the top and bottom of the funnel.",
      "Now, KBX leverages the full 6sense platform withSales IntelligenceandEmail Agents, creating a harmonious revenue strategy across sales and marketing.",
      "6sense Sales Intelligence and Email Agents | “Before 6sense, we had to hunt and fish for contact data,” Chris says, “we used to dig through LinkedIn Sales Navigator to find someone within the C-Suite to talk to. That wasted a lot of time.”",
      "6sense Sales Intelligence gives KBX sellers accurate contact data within a matter of minutes, without having to leave the platform. It also helps guide the sales team on which of the 30+ capabilities we offer to highlight in their messaging. Relevant messaging to the right contacts has been a game changer.",
      "“The contact data within 6sense has been crucial in helping us streamline so we can reach out via email and add the contact to our CRM right away,” Chris says.",
      "Then, Email Agents engages contacts and re-engages cold leads, making for a streamlined sales process.",
      "Adding both Sales Intelligence and Email Agents has helped the KBX sales team to get a comprehensive view of their target accounts, understand their buying intent, and find the right contacts within those accounts.",
      "“Having all this information one or two clicks away, rather than having to sift through multiple platforms has been a huge timesaver for our team. Seeing the marketing feeding into the bottom of the funnel and getting more accounts into the top of the funnel that are aware of KBX — sellers can see which marketing activities they’ve already engaged with. Sellers then know what to talk about with those accounts in their initial outreach.”",
      "The results | Before 6sense, KBX’s go-to-market strategy consisted of cold-calling, Excel spreadsheets, and crossing fingers. Now, integrating Salesforce with the full 6sense platform has aligned sales and marketing resources with vital data that allows them to focus efforts on accounts showing real interest.",

      "Paul Russell, the London-based Global Customer Marketing Director at Vertiv, has been with the organization for over eight years. Noticing a sea change in the way B2B buyers operate, he decided to explore how 6sense could help stress test a new account-based marketing (ABM) approach in an untapped marketplace.",
      "Paul explains how he was able to leverage 6sense intent data to revolutionize the way Vertiv approached their go-to-market strategy in a new territory, while delivering impressive results. For any business facing the challenges of international expansion, there’s much to learn.",
      "The challenge: adapting to modern buyer behaviors | The modern B2B buying journey has drastically changed. According to Frost and Sullivan, 81% of B2B technical content users prefer to self-serve, and McKinsey reports that buyers spend only 6% of their total buying time with sales reps per vendor. 6sense’s own research shows that 70% of buyers prefer no interaction with sales reps at all.",
      "Despite their large footprint with Fortune 500 businesses, Vertiv recognized these shifts and knew that their approach to sales needed to evolve.",
      "“Understanding and adapting to the modern buyer’s journey was crucial,” Russell told us. “We needed a strategy that aligned with their preferences for less direct interaction while still effectively reaching our target market.”",
      "The solution: Project Opera | To address these changes, Russell launched Project Opera, a six-month pilot to test a new GTM strategy in Australia and New Zealand, far from executive oversight. They chose this underpenetrated mid-market region due to its strong local sales leadership and an Australian culture of honest feedback.",
      "While years in the business gave Vertiv a good sense of their Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), they had never paired this with intent data to understand what portion of their Total Addressable Market (TAM) was looking to shop for solutions.",

      "Engagement plan | Vertiv used the 6sense platform integrated with the Eloqua Marketing Automation Platform (MAP) to understand market behavior. They focused on important keywords and topics to identify potential customers. They defined an ICP for mid-market companies and reviewed their contact data to ensure they were targeting the right accounts.",
      "Their GTM strategy started with understanding their Total Addressable Market (TAM), which included mid-market enterprises with over $10M in revenue. They narrowed down from 120,000 companies with over 100 employees to 35,000 companies with over 500 employees, focusing on key industries. Among these, they identified 2,181 accounts that were actively looking for solutions—about 6% of their TAM.",

The pilot not only achieved a $1 million pipeline within the first four weeks but also saw an 80% increase in marketing-found pipeline from the previous quarter. Web traffic from target accounts surged by 428%, and the first order was secured within just seven weeks of BDR engagement.",
      "Vertiv surrounded high-intent accounts with customized ads on LinkedIn, Google Ads, 6sense, and YouTube. This programmatic advertising significantly increased unique visitors to Vertiv.com and reduced CPM costs by 90%. Additionally, BDR outreach was crucial, with a 12% increase in call connect rates compared to non-ABM outreach and BDRs finding, on average, four qualified opportunities per week.",
      "“The pilot not only validated our ABM strategy but also showcased the power of precise targeting and alignment between sales and marketing. 6sense was instrumental in our success, providing the insights needed to capture and engage our most valuable prospects.”",
      "Conclusion: A blueprint for future success | Project Opera has set a precedent for Vertiv’s future marketing endeavors. With the success of the pilot, Vertiv plans to expand their use of predictive analytics to better identify accounts likely to buy, estimate potential spend, and predict deal closure timelines.",

B2B marketers can automate repetitive tasks such as lead nurturing, email campaigns, social media posting, andB2B programmatic advertising. This improves operational efficiency, saves time, and allows marketers to focus on strategic activities that require human expertise. | Improved customer experience:AI can enhance the overall customer experience. Chatbots and virtual assistants can provide instant and personalized support to customers, improving satisfaction and engagement. AI-powered recommendation engines can also deliver relevant content, products, and services to customers. | Real-time insights:AI can provide real-time insights into campaign performance, customer behavior, and market trends. This agility allows marketers to optimize their strategies in real-time. | Cost and resource efficiency:AI can boost ROI by allocating resources more effectively. By automating tasks and leveraging AI analytics, businesses can reduce manual efforts, improve productivity, and make data-backed decisions.",
      "Data privacy concerns:Using AI for B2B marketing involves collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, which raises concerns aboutdata privacy and security. Mishandling or unauthorized access to sensitive customer data can lead to reputational damage and legal implications. | Lack of human touch:AI-driven marketing strategies may lack the human touch that is essential in building personal connections. Over-reliance on automation and AI algorithms can result in a detached and impersonal customer experience, potentially leading to reduced trust and engagement. | Initial setup and implementation costs:Implementing AI technologies for B2B marketing requires significant upfront investment. Costs include acquiring AI tools, training algorithms, integrating systems, and hiring or training personnel with AI expertise. These initial setup and implementation costs can be a barrier for some organizations, particularlysmaller businesseswith limited budgets. | Risk of algorithmic bias:AI algorithms used in B2B marketing may unintentionally exhibit bias based on the data they are trained on. This bias can result in unfair or discriminatory targeting, potentially harming brand reputation and customer relationships. Regular monitoring and auditing of AI systems is necessary tomitigate this risk. | Dependency on accurate data:AI algorithms heavily rely on accurate and high-quality data to deliver meaningful insights and predictions. Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to flawed recommendations, misguided targeting, and ineffective decision-making. Maintaining data quality and integrity is crucial to avoid negative consequences when using AI in marketing. | Over-reliance on technology:While AI can provide valuable insights and automate processes, over-reliance on technology can hinder creativity and human intuition in B2B marketing. It’s essential to strike a balance between leveraging AI capabilities and preserving the human touch to foster innovation, adaptability, and customer-centric strategies. | Potential job displacement:The adoption of AI in B2B marketing may lead to job displacement for some roles that can be automated. AI algorithms can handle many tasks in data analysis, content creation, and campaign optimization, reducing the need for certain job positions. It’s important for businesses to plan for reskilling and upskilling employees to adapt to the changing landscape and leverage AI as a complement to human expertise rather than a replacement.",

    "meta_description": "Study the art of creating successful Account-Based Marketing campaigns that align sales and marketing teams, enhance targeting, and boost revenue.",
    "p": [
      "92% of companies say ABM delivers higher ROIthan any other marketing approach. So why do many ABM campaigns struggle to move the needle?",
      "The answer lies in a fundamental misunderstanding.Most B2B organizations think they’re running ABM campaigns when they’re really just doing lead generation with fancier targeting.They cast a slightly smaller net, add a company name to email subject lines, and call it “account-based marketing.”",
      "RealABM campaignswork differently. They treat each target account like a market of one, with custom research, tailored messaging, and orchestrated experiences across multiple touchpoints. They’re surgical, not spray-and-pray.",
      "The difference shows up in the results. Companies running true ABM campaigns — like the ones we’ll explore in this guide — see5x increases in pipeline velocity, 35% win rates from targeted accounts, and cost savings in the tens of thousands within months of launch (more on these real-life 6sense customer success stories later).",
      "This guide will show you how to build campaigns that actually convert, not just generate activity.",
      "We’ll walk through proven frameworks, tactical playbooks, and the technology integrations that turn good ideas into revenue-generating machines. By the end, you’ll have everything you need to plan, launch, and optimize ABM campaigns.",
      "What is an ABM campaign? | An ABM campaign is a coordinated, time-bound marketing initiative that treats specific high-value accounts as individual markets. Unlike broader B2B marketing strategies that encompass sales territory planning and customer success programs, ABM campaigns are focused efforts designed to move target accounts from awareness to consideration to decision within a defined timeframe.",
      "The defining characteristic of ABM campaigns is their account-centric approach to execution.Rather than targeting job titles or demographics, these campaigns target named companies and orchestrate multi-channel experiences for entire buying committees. Every touchpoint — from display ads to email sequences to sales outreach — delivers consistent messaging that builds toward a unified narrative, even when engaging different stakeholders within the same organization.",
      "ABM campaigns differ fundamentally from lead nurturing and demand generation in their measurement and optimization approach. Success isn’t measured by individual prospect actions like email opens or form fills, but by account-level progression through buying stages. You’re not trying to generate maximum leads; you’re trying to advance specific accounts through your sales process with measurable engagement from multiple stakeholders.",
      "Modern ABM campaigns leverageintent dataand predictive analytics to time engagement when accounts are actively researching solutions. Theytransform campaign execution from interruption-based marketing to value-driven conversations that align with natural buying behavior.",
      "The best way to understandwhat makes ABM campaigns successfulis to examine what’s working right now. These three case studies show how different approaches to account-based marketing can drive dramatic results — and reveal the common patterns that separate winning campaigns from costly experiments.",
      "BioCatch, a leader in behavioral biometrics for financial crime prevention, faced a classic ABM challenge: how do you reach decision-makers at the world’s largest banks with messaging that resonates?",
      "Their previous approach relied on traditional marketing tactics that generated unqualified leads. Without insights into real customer intent, Jonathan Daly’s team was essentially guessing which banks were ready to buy and when to reach out.",
      "“We didn’t want to be on an ad platform where we were wasting even a penny showing ads to people who didn’t care or were not within our ICP,” Jonathan explains.",
      "BioCatch needed to break through the noise in a highly regulated industry where decision-making involves multiple stakeholders and long evaluation cycles. Traditional marketing approaches weren’t working because they couldn’t identify which banks were actively researching fraud prevention solutions or which specific pain points were driving their search.",
      "Working with MarketBridge, BioCatch built a sophisticated account-based experience (ABX) strategy targeting 553 of the world’s largest banks. The goal was ambitious: move these accounts from “unengaged” to “engaged,” and get 60 accounts into active pipeline stages.",
      "Precise segmentation and targeting:BioCatch created over 200 audience segments based on bank size, geography, current technology stack, and buying signals. This wasn’t basic firmographic targeting — they were identifying specific banks showing intent for fraud prevention solutions using 6sense’s AI-powered insights.",
      "Intent-driven campaign timing:6sense revealed which specific keywords those 553 banks were searching for related to behavioral biometrics, fraud detection, and financial crime prevention. When a bank’s research activity spiked around these topics, BioCatch knew it was time to intensify outreach and engagement.",
      "Multi-channel orchestration:Rather than relying on a single touchpoint, they coordinated messaging across 6sense Display Ads, LinkedIn advertising, Google Ads, and used personalized landing pages. Each channel reinforced the same core message while adapting to the platform’s unique strengths and audience expectations.",
      "Massive creative and content output:The team produced over 450 creative assets and built more than 10 landing pages, each tailored to specific audience segments and buyer journey stages. This wasn’t cookie-cutter content — each asset addressed the specific compliance, security, and operational challenges facing different types of financial institutions.",
      "But the real breakthrough was qualitative: “What fascinates me as a communication geek and what excites me about 6sense is that it allows us to listen,” Jonathan says. “If we’re patient and take the time to listen to the signals, we can understand what is meaningful to our buyers and who is a good fit for our product.”",
      "The campaign transformed BioCatch from a company pushing messages into the market to one that responds to demonstrated buyer interest with relevant, timely engagement.",
      "Reachdesk, a global gifting platform, had a problem familiar to most sales organizations: their outbound strategy was built on guesswork. SDRs were making calls and sending emails, but they had no way to identify which accounts were actually in-market for their solution.",
      "“We just didn’t have an understanding of which accounts might be in-market, and couldn’t tie keyword searches or content consumption to website visitors,” says Ben Smith, Marketing Director at Reachdesk.",
      "The result was inefficient targeting, lower conversion rates, and frustrated sales reps who felt like they were shooting in the dark.",
      "Reachdesk needed to shift from reactive lead response to proactive account engagement. Their existing process waited for prospects to raise their hands through form fills or demo requests. But in competitive markets, waiting for inbound interest often means missing opportunities to competitor who engage earlier in the buyer journey.",
      "Reachdesk implemented 6sense as their intent data foundation and built their entire sales process around buyer signals. This created a fundamental shift in how they approach prospecting and account engagement.",
      "Daily intent monitoring and action:BDRs start each day by pulling reports of accounts showing 6sense intent signals. They examine the type of intent — website visits, keyword searches, content consumption — directly within Salesforce through the 6sense widget. No need to switch between applications; the key information is integrated into their existing workflow.",
      "Signal-based prioritization:“Out of all the signals we look at on a daily basis, 6sense intent signals always seem to be the strongest in terms of who’s most likely to enter the funnel and ultimately close,” says Brandon Ray, Head of Global Outbound Demand Generation.",
      "Integrated technology stack:6sense connects with Salesloft for orchestrated outreach sequences and their own gifting platform for re-engagement campaigns. This creates a seamless workflow from intent detection to qualified opportunity, ensuring no signals fall through the cracks.",
      "AI-powered follow-up automation:Reachdesk recently added 6senseAI Email Agentsto automate follow-ups for prospects who had previously engaged with their gifting campaigns. This allows them to maintain consistent touchpoints without overwhelming their sales team.",
      "The shift from guesswork to intent-driven selling delivered measurable improvements across their entire revenue operation:",
      "“It’s the difference between being reactive and proactive,” Ben explains. “We’re not waiting for someone to fill out a form — we’re reaching out to them at the right time, with the right message, because we can see the buying signals.”",
      "Brandon adds: “I can’t imagine a world without it. It would just be a guessing game in terms of who we should be reaching out to and when.” The combination of 6sense intent data and Reachdesk’s gifting platform creates what he calls “the best one-two punch in terms of generating the type of pipeline that closes.”",
      "JAGGAER, a global leader in procurement software, faced a resource challenge that many enterprise companies know well. Despite having a marketing team of around 50 people, their ABX team in North America consisted of just two professionals who were already at full capacity.",
      "“We needed to maximize efficiency and effectiveness in managing our ABX tech stack, but lacked the internal bandwidth to audit and improve our processes,” explains Annika Helmrich, VP of Growth Marketing.",
      "The company had implemented 6sense but was struggling with low adoption across sales and marketing teams. Without proper utilization, they weren’t seeing the ROI they needed to justify their ABX investment.",
      "JAGGAER had set ambitious targets for 2024, but their small ABX team was struggling to support these goals effectively. They needed to either hire additional resources or find a way to dramatically improve efficiency with their existing team structure.",
      "JAGGAER partnered with 6sense and their Teal-Level Agency Services Partner,2X, to completely overhaul their ABX approach. The solution focused on automation and expert support rather than adding internal headcount.",
      "Optimized 6sense implementation:2X brought certified marketing-as-a-service expertise to work as an extension of JAGGAER’s team, providing the bandwidth to orchestrate comprehensive campaigns from accountsegmentationto real-time intent-driven outreach.",
      "AI-driven automation and scoring:They implemented 6sense’s Predictive Analytics for automatic scoring of hot accounts in-market and Intelligent Workflows to dynamically segment audiences based on account behavior and route qualified accounts to appropriate sales reps.",
      "Comprehensive technology integration:6sense was integrated with existing technologies including Folloze, Salesforce CRM, Pardot, Outreach, Qualified webchat, Google Analytics, and Looker Studio, creating seamless workflow automation across their entire tech stack.",
      "Custom reporting and analytics:2X built a comprehensive, real-time campaign outcomes dashboard using Looker Studio, giving the marketing team clear visibility into performance metrics and campaign effectiveness.",
      "The combination of 6sense automation and expert support delivered immediate impact that exceeded expectations:",
      "“The combination of 6sense and their service partner, 2X, has been a game-changer for our ABX strategy,” Annika says. “Despite having a small team, we can now execute campaigns with greater precision and achieve remarkable results.”",
      "The partnership also improved overall performance across JAGGAER’s tech stack, reduced cost per qualified opportunity compared to their pre-6sense period, and provided real-time performance insights that empowered data-driven decision making.",
      "What these wins have in common | While these three companies operate in different markets with different solutions, their successful ABM campaigns share several critical elements that any organization can apply:",
      "Intent data as the strategic foundation:All three companies use buyer intent signals to time their outreach, eliminating the guesswork about when prospects are ready to engage. This transforms cold outreach into warm conversations.",
      "Multi-channel orchestration:None relied on a single touchpoint. They coordinated consistent messaging across email, advertising, social media, and direct outreach to create comprehensive experiences that build awareness and credibility over time.",
      "Technology integration for seamless workflows:Success came from connecting their ABM platform with existing sales and marketing tools, creating smooth handoffs and eliminating manual tasks that slow down response times.",
      "Systematic, repeatable processes:Each company developed frameworks for identifying accounts, crafting messaging, and measuring results that could be executed consistently regardless of individual team member availability.",
      "Cross-team alignment:Sales and marketing worked from the same playbook, with shared metrics, regular communication, and joint accountability for results.",
      "These patterns aren’t coincidental — they represent the core requirements for ABM campaign success. The companies that consistently generate pipeline from their target accounts follow these same principles, regardless of their industry or deal size.",
      "ABM campaign types: Choosing your strategic approach | Not all ABM campaigns require the same level of personalization and resource investment. The most successful campaigns start with choosing the right approach for your market reality, available resources, and business objectives.",
      "Think of it like choosing the right tool for the job. You wouldn’t use a sledgehammer to hang a picture frame, and you wouldn’t use a small hammer to demolish a wall. ABM campaign types work the same way — the approach must match the opportunity.",
      "Strategic (1:1) campaigns: Maximum precision and personalization | Strategic campaigns treat each target account like a market of one. Everything is custom — research, messaging, content, and outreach. This is ABM at its most precise and resource-intensive, designed for your highest-value opportunities.",
      "Resource investment:High touch with dedicated team members focusing on each account. You’ll need custom content creation, executive involvement, and often face-to-face relationship building through events and meetings.",
      "Timeline expectations:6-18 months to see full results, though engagement should begin within the first quarter and provide leading indicators of progress.",
      "A strategic campaign might involve creating a custom market analysis report for a single prospect, hosting an executive roundtable at their industry conference, developing a proof-of-concept specific to their use case, and facilitating peer conversations with existing customers in similar situations.",
      "6sense advantage in strategic campaigns:Deepaccount intelligencereveals which executives are engaging with your content, when they’re most active, what topics resonate most, and how decision-making processes typically unfold. This intelligence helps you optimize your high-touch interactions for maximum impact and avoid wasting time on unengaged stakeholders.",
      "Cluster (1:few) campaigns: Targeted segmentation with scale | Cluster campaigns focus on groups of similar accounts that share common characteristics — industry, company size, technology stack, or business challenges. You’re still personalizing extensively, but you’re leveraging commonalities to scale your efforts efficiently.",
      "Resource investment:Moderate personalization with templated frameworks that can be adapted. You’ll create segment-specific content that addresses common pain points while allowing for account-level customization.",
      "Timeline expectations:3-9 months to see significant results, with initial engagement appearing in the first 6-8 weeks as your content and outreach reach market.",
      "A cluster campaign might target all mid-size healthcare organizations implementing new patient management systems. You’d develop content around healthcare-specific compliance challenges, host webinars on industry trends, sponsor relevant healthcare conferences, and create case studies featuring similar healthcare organizations.",
      "6sense advantage in cluster campaigns:Predictive segmentation helps identify accounts that look like your best customers within each cluster. Intent data reveals industry-wide trends and buying patterns, helping you time campaign launches and optimize messaging. Competitive intelligence shows which alternative solutions accounts are evaluating.",
      "Scaled (1:many) campaigns: Systematic automation with broad reach | Scaled campaigns apply ABM principles to larger groups of accounts using automation and AI-powered personalization. You’re maintaining account focus while leveraging technology to reach hundreds or thousands of prospects efficiently.",
      "Resource investment:Lower per-account investment with heavy automation. You’ll rely on dynamic content, programmatic advertising, and marketing automation to scale personalization without manual customization.",
      "Timeline expectations:1-6 months to initial results, with optimization happening in real-time based on engagement data and performance metrics.",
      "A scaled campaign might target all companies in the 100-500 employee range that recently received Series B funding. Dynamic content would adjust messaging based on their industry and funding stage, while programmatic ads would follow them across the web with relevant offers and success stories.",
      "6sense advantage in scaled campaigns:AI-powered audience building identifies accounts showing buying signals across your entire addressable market, and ties keyword and topic research to specific accounts. Automated personalization delivers relevant content at scale, while intent-based triggering ensures you’re reaching accounts when they’re actively researching solutions like yours.",
      "Decision framework: Choosing the right approach | Choosing the right campaign type isn’t just about available resources — it’s about matching your approach to market reality, customer expectations, and business objectives.",
      "The hybrid model advantage:Many successful companies don’t choose just one approach. They might run strategic campaigns for their top 10 enterprise prospects, cluster campaigns for mid-market segments, and scaled campaigns for smaller opportunities. The key is having clear criteria for which accounts get which treatment and ensuring smooth transitions as accounts progress or demonstrate higher engagement.",
      "Remember: you can always start with a scaled approach and promote high-potential accounts to cluster or strategic treatment as they show engagement and buying signals. It’s much harder to go the other direction without disappointing prospects who expect high-touch experiences.",
      "Building successful ABM campaigns requires systematic execution of a proven process.",
      "This framework has been tested across hundreds of campaigns and refined based on what drives results, not what sounds good in theory. Follow it methodically, and you’ll avoid the common mistakes that derail most ABM initiatives.",
      "Step 1: Define campaign objectives and success metrics | Most ABM campaigns fail because they start with tactics instead of objectives. Before you think about target accounts or messaging, get crystal clear on what success looks like and how you’ll measure progress toward your goals.",
      "6sense integration opportunity:Use historical performance data from similar account segments to set realistic benchmarks and timeline expectations. Analyze patterns from successful past campaigns to inform goal setting.",
      "Deliverable:Create a campaign charter document with clear objectives, success metrics, timeline, resource allocation, and stakeholder approval.",
      "Step 2: Build your ideal customer profile and target account list | Your ICP isn’t just a marketing exercise — it’s the foundation for every campaign decision. Spend time getting this right, because everything else depends on targeting the right accounts with the right approach.",
      "Deliverable:Generate a prioritized target account list with fit scores, intent indicators, competitive analysis, and initial account intelligence.",
      "Step 3: Deep account research and intelligence gathering | This step separates successful ABM campaigns from expensive lead generation exercises. You’re not just collecting basic company information — you’re developing insights that inform every aspect of your campaign strategy and messaging.",
      "Deliverable:Build and/or review detailed account profiles with organizational charts, key initiatives, technology stack analysis, stakeholder influence maps, and competitive situation assessment.",
      "Step 4: Develop messaging and content strategy | Generic messaging kills ABM campaigns. Your research should inform specific, relevant messaging that speaks to each account’s unique situation, priorities, and challenges. Tailor messaging to individual buyer personas and buying stages so you can build influence by delivering value throughout the buying journey.",
      "Deliverable:Build a comprehensive messaging guide with stakeholder-specific value propositions, content calendar with asset creation timeline, and content performance measurement plan.",
      "Step 5: Design multi-channel campaign architecture | Channel selection and sequencing can make or break your campaign effectiveness. You’re not just choosing where to advertise — you’re designing a customer experience that guides accounts through their research while building credibility and trust.",
      "Deliverable:Detailed campaign architecture diagram with channel strategy, technology requirements, measurement framework, and implementation timeline.",
      "Valuable resource:The2024 Buyer Experience Reporthas a wealth of data about how B2B buyers make decisions.",
      "Step 6: Campaign launch and execution | Campaign launch is where planning meets reality. Even the best strategy fails without disciplined execution, monitoring, and adjustment.",
      "Deliverable:Document processes, set a performance baseline, plan optimization procedures, complete team training, then launch your new campaign.",
      "Step 7: Monitor, measure, and optimize | Successful ABM campaigns evolve continuously. What works in month one may not work in month three as market conditions change, accounts progress through buying cycles, and competitive dynamics shift.",
      "Deliverable:Weekly performance reports with optimization recommendations, monthly strategic reviews, and quarterly campaign evolution planning.",
      "Step 8: Results analysis and campaign evolution | Campaign success isn’t just about hitting your initial metrics — it’s about building a sustainable, scalable approach that improves over time and provides insights for future campaigns.",
      "Deliverable:Provide a comprehensive campaign results report with detailed analysis, lessons learned, recommendations for future campaigns, and a strategic evolution roadmap.",
      "This framework works because it balances careful planning with agile execution, measurement with optimization, and strategy with tactics. Follow it systematically, and you’ll build campaigns that don’t just generate activity — they generate predictable revenue growth.",
      "Building your ABM campaign team and measuring success | ABM campaigns succeed or fail based on the people executing them and the metrics they optimize for.",
      "Campaign owner/ABM manager | This person owns overall campaign success. They’re accountable for results and responsible for keeping everyone aligned and moving toward shared objectives.",
      "Account research specialist | This person ensures your team understands target accounts deeply enough to create relevant, compelling experiences that resonate with specific business challenges.",
      "Skills needed:Business research, data analysis, attention to detail, strategic thinking, industry knowledge",
      "Content marketing lead | This role ensures your campaign has the right content to engage stakeholders at every stage of the buying journey. They translate account research into compelling, relevant content experiences that drive progression.",
      "Marketing operations | ABM campaigns require sophisticated data management. This person ensures your systems work together seamlessly and data flows correctly to enable optimization.",
      "Sales development representative (SDR) | SDRs bridge the gap between marketing campaigns and sales conversations. In ABM, they need to be more strategic and research-focused than traditional lead generation SDRs.",
      "Success metrics and optimization framework | The key to effective ABM team management and measurement is treating campaign execution like a cross-functional project with clear owners, defined processes, shared accountability, and continuous optimization based on real performance data rather than assumptions.",
      "Common ABM campaign pitfalls and how to avoid them | Every failed ABM campaign follows a predictable pattern. Teams start with enthusiasm, implement tactics they’ve read about, and then wonder why their “account-based marketing” generates more activity than revenue. Here are the most critical mistakes and how to avoid them.",
      "The problem:Teams run broad campaigns with light personalization and call it “account-based marketing.” They add company names to email subject lines, create industry-specific landing pages, and target by firmographics — but they’re still optimizing for volume over depth.",
      "The solution:Start with fewer accounts and deeper personalization. Use the “dinner party test” — if you wouldn’t feel comfortable discussing their specific business challenges over dinner, you don’t know the account well enough for effective ABM.",
      "The problem:Marketing develops target lists and campaigns without meaningful sales input. Sales reps get leads from accounts they’ve never heard of with messaging they don’t understand.",
      "The solution:Joint planning sessions where sales and marketing collaborate on account selection, messaging development, and success metrics. Both teams should co-own the target account list and campaign results.",
      "The problem:Teams create “personalized” campaigns based on basic firmographic data. The messaging feels generic because it doesn’t reflect deep understanding of specific business challenges.",
      "The solution:Create detailed account intelligence profiles that include business context, stakeholder maps, and strategic insights — not just contact information.",
      "The problem:Teams expect immediate pipeline from ABM campaigns and abandon strategies before they have time to work. ABM requires relationship building, which takes time in B2B environments.",
      "The solution:Set realistic timelines — expect 3-6 months for initial meaningful results. Track engagement depth, account progression, and sales team feedback as early indicators before revenue materializes.",
      "The problem:Teams assume sophisticated ABM technology will solve strategy and execution challenges. They focus on platform features instead of fundamental marketing principles.",
      "The solution:Focus on process and people first, then add technology to amplify what’s working. Prove your ABM approach with smaller, manually-executed campaigns before investing in automation.",
      "Your next steps to ABM campaign success | Building high-converting ABM campaigns isn’t about perfect technology, unlimited budgets, or secret tactics. The companies achieving 5x pipeline increases, 35% win rates, and significant cost savings follow systematic approaches that combine strategic thinking with disciplined execution.",
      "Remember: ABM campaigns are marathons, not sprints.The accounts that convert in month six often started engaging in month one. Your job is to stay top-of-mind with valuable, relevant interactions until they’re ready to buy.",
      "The future belongs to organizations that combine account-based precision with modern marketing technology to create experiences that feel personal at scale. By following the strategies, tactics, and frameworks in this guide, you’ll build campaigns that don’t just generate leads — they create customers.",

      "Salla Eskola, currently the senior director of global growth marketing at Corporate Visions, has seen the company through multiple iterations of strategy shifts in her six-year tenure. | Lack of intent data: The team struggled to identify and prioritize high-intent accounts effectively. | Inefficient targeting: Resources were often wasted on prospects that weren’t ready to buy. | Limited visibility: The sales team lacked insights into account behavior and buying signals. | Siloed approach: The company’s ABM strategy was outdated and not systematically implemented.",

      "With a global reach, delivering network connectivity to enterprise and government sites in over 190 countries, Expereo has been helping businesses stay securely connected since 2004. However, in late 2022, Expereo faced significant challenges in their marketing efforts. | Of the 2000 MQLs generated, 1700 were unqualified banner clicks. | 95% of leads sent to sales weren’t from the target market. | A million dollars spent on events yielded no attributable results.",
      "Marc Brunel-Walker, Expereo’s Director of Global Demand Generation, has worked in marketing for over 25 years. Shortly after joining Expereo, Marc had a career-changing moment when he brought in 6sense. “I couldn’t imagine doing what I do now without having 6sense in my pocket as part of the team. It’s integral to everything we do – when I speak to our CRO, the first question he asks is, what does 6sense say?”",
      "The challenge: When marketing goes wrong | When Marc joined Expereo in November 2022, the marketing situation was dire. The Chief Customer Officer bluntly described it as, “It’s all crap.” The state of play was chaotic:",
      "Sales and marketing were so misaligned that sales had started organizing their own events. The existing tech stack failed to provide usable insights, leading Marc to realize, “I spent my first 8 weeks lifting up the hood and saying what’s wrong with this engine? Before I realized, ah, it doesn’t exist.”",
      "In a bold move, Marc decided to switch everything off to rebuild the marketing foundations from scratch.",
      "Rebuilding the marketing foundations | Identifying the issues was straightforward: spray-and-pray tactics, untargeted ‘always-on’ display ads, and skyrocketing CPLs. The challenge was determining the solution. Expereo had a non-linear buying experience and unclear primary personas.",
      "Re-establishing trust with the sales team was paramount for Marc.“You need some stress between sales and marketing – but if the balance is all one way, it gets out of hand.”Marc’s search for a replacement for his B2B directory led him to 6sense, which hooked him with its data, intent engine, and account-based insights.",
      "With 6sense in place, Marc had a vision for a brighter future.",
      "The solution: 6sense | 6sense’s intent data provided an initial clarity that Marc quickly leveraged across his strategy. From account targeting and planning to content syndication, 6sense became integral to nearly everything Marc was doing.",
      "“We went from being an absolute mess 18 months previously –1.5% of MQLs from our target environment, to 87%. Transformational doesn’t quite cut it.”",
      "From guess-led to data-driven insight: 6sense in action | Previously, any signal indicated high intent, which meant none were truly high intent. With 6sense, Marc could track marketing impact at an account level and determine buying stages.",
      "“We did a comparison for the first 6 months and before – by the end of last year, we were 14 times more likely to find an opportunity in the first 90 days of prospecting as a result of the knowledge 6sense provided. When we turned it on, this was less than 1 in 3.”",
      "The chaotic data and strategy were streamlined, transforming Expereo’s approach from ocean fishing to targeted, high-probability engagements.",
      "An evolving strategy: MQLs to MQAs with 6sense | Sales and marketing were now walking in lockstep, allowing Marc to focus on evolving Expereo’s strategy. “If I’d said to people 6-9 months ago, I’m going to deliver not just MQLs but fully-fledged MQAs, people would have laughed at me. But suddenly that doesn’t seem so funny at all.”",
      "Marc’s team is building an MQA scoring model based on engagement, intent, and buying signals, already yielding impressive results. “When marketing can hand over not just a few hot leads, but 5-10 highly qualified leads with strong data on 80-90 people within an IT team, it becomes a different ball game.”",
      "Results powered by 6sense | The transformation driven by 6sense led to phenomenal results from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024:",
      "Expereo’s success was recognized at the B2B Awards in the US, where the judging panel verified the impressive 34% conversion rate for content syndication.",
      "Conclusion | “When I say 6sense is at the heart of everything we do now. I really mean it. I wish I’d had it five or six years ago. I believe it’s the future of transformation.”",

      "The challenge: Increase outbound output with targeted outreach | Bynder has strong brand recognition in the DAM market, but as Dónal Ó Mearáin explains, the marketing team wanted to diversify pipeline by upping its outbound efforts. “We needed to add different strings to our bow in how we engaged the market,” Bynder’s Director of Lifecycle Marketing said.",
      "The company already had a database of accounts and understood their total addressable market (TAM). But to set their BDRs up for success, they needed a better understanding of their prospects’ behavior and buying propensity.",

      "Aligning outbound efforts in EMEA & North America | Now with revenue teams positioned on either side of the pond, Bynder uses 6sense to optimize its outbound efforts in both EMEA and North America.",

      "In this How-To, we provide a practical, tactical dive into some of the strategies outlined in Chapter 4.",
      "In her bookNo Forms. No Spam. No Cold Calls, 6sense CMO Latané Conant points out that B2B revenue teams are always asked to do more.Butmorerarely meansbetter. In fact, when marketers and salesfolk spread themselves too thin, they’re likely to lose focus and fumble opportunities.",
      "These fumbles, Conant says, are often caused by disagreements within the revenue team on which metrics deliver the most impact to an organization’s pipeline.",
      "She writes: “If we want to get the entire team engaged in creating predictable revenue growth, it’s crucial for sales and marketing teams to align on goals, data, and metrics. A siloed approach sets even the most sophisticated strategies and tactics up for lackluster results. … (A) lot of organizations aren’t even tracking the metrics they need to create and stick to an effective revenue operating model.”",
      "So, what are these most-important metrics? Benchmarking the ones below will provide visibility into your pipeline stages and key activities that can help you progress accounts toward deals.",
      "But first, some metrics-related context | As we dive into this topic, you might encounter the names of some unfamiliar metrics — particularly ones mentioned within the early stages of the sales process.",
      "This will be especially so if your revenue team uses traditional MQL-based models, which rely heavily on information that interested buyers provide via webforms or demo requests. This typically occurs near the end of a buyer’s journey.",
      "However, the metrics we’ll share reflect buyer activities that occur much earlier in the buyer’s journey. These activities — which reflect buyers’ online research —are often invisible to selling teamsbecause they’re generated on third-party websites, message boards, digital trade publications, and social networks.",
      "Account-based marketing and sales intelligence tools (like 6sense) can detect, compile, and analyze these early-stage buyer intent signals and convert them into meaningful metrics. These metrics may differ by name, depending on which tool you use. For our purposes, we’ll use terminology from the 6sense platform for consistency.",
      "(Check out this resourceif you’d like to compare some of these metrics to their traditional-marketing equivalents.)",
      "With that out of the way, let’s take a closer look.",
      "A buyer’s journey begins as soon as a buyer starts searching for a solution for an issue they need to solve. A tool that tracks these buyer intent signals can help you spotwhenan account has begun its buying journey.",
      "Tools like 6sense can take this a step further by analyzing signals to determinewherean account sits in its buying process. This is important because it enables you to personalize your communication with accounts as they progress through the funnel. It also nails the timing for outreach so you’re not too late (or too early) to start a one-on-one conversation.",
      "As an account’s journey progresses and their interests increase in specific ways, it’s identified as a Sales Qualified Lead (SQL). At 6sense, we call these 6QAs (6sense Qualified Accounts).",
      "This change is based on a combination of how closely an account matches your ideal customer profile (ICP) and how engaged buying team personas are in their research. The goal at this stage of the pipeline is to progress accounts from their initial awareness toward becoming a 6QA.",
      "From 6QA to meeting | Once accounts become 6QAs (or SQLs), it’s time for your reps to engage in live conversations.",
      "It’s time to examine what might be preventing prospects from taking the next step.",

      "Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Web Traffic | How many of your targeted accounts are visiting your website? This is an indication of how well you’re reaching and enticing target customers. | ICP Engagement | How actively are accounts researching the problems you can solve, the solutions you can offer, your brand, and competitors? | Predictive Model Metrics | How many of the accounts in your pipeline are a “strong fit” — meaning they closely resemble past deals? AI and machine learning scores all of your opportunities to determine which accounts are “strong fit” vs. “moderate fit” or “weak fit.” | Segmentation | How precisely are you able to segment your audience? This provides insights into the accuracy and robustness of your account data. | Share of Voice (SOV) | How visible is your brand compared to competitors? Are you reaching your ICP often enough to make an impression, even amid competition? | Accounts Reached | This represents how many unique contacts within target accounts are seeing your marketing content, indicating the effectiveness of your methods for segmenting and targeting prospects. | View-Through Rate (VTR) | How much of your audience takes further action after viewing a piece of content? Thanks to buying signals that track account behavior, you can see how campaigns influence research — no clicks required. | AR (Accounts Reached) Engagement | Which of your campaigns are influencing pipeline, and is that influence growing or shrinking? | CTAs | What are the conversion rates for your calls to action? Which CTAs attract the most engagement with certain audience segments? | Creative & Content | Which types of content and creative have the most influence? Should you double down on certain content types? Is there a piece of content that is underperforming and may need to be reworked? | Keywords | Are you tracking the right keywords and topics? Look at which accounts are progressing and the keywords being used. Consider expanding your targeting to include related keywords.",
      "Conversion Rate & Velocity | How quickly accounts are progressing through the pipeline? Which outreach efforts are in getting the right people in meetings? | Cadence | How often are you reaching out and engaging with accounts? | Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) | Once a lead is qualified, you should have an agreed-upon timeframe for reaching out. Is the sales team consistently meeting that timeframe? If not, what can be done to overcome any obstacles? | 6QAs Worked | How many 6sense Qualified Accounts (aka Sales Qualified Leads) are currently being engaged? Are your marketing efforts successfully turning strong fit prospects into 6QAs, and are those 6QAs being reached by sales reps? | ICP Engagement | This shows how engaged ICP accounts are with marketing content and advertising. Critically, consider how many buyer personas are engaged and the steps you can take to increase the number of buying team members exposed to content. | CTAs | Which calls to action (CTAs) are leading to meetings or engagement? | Web & Content Experience | How effortlessly can contacts at target accounts move through your website and access relevant content? Look at page depth, time on site, and other metrics to find ways to improve the user experience. Consider how you can use intent data and audience segments to personalize the website experience for prospects. | Bot Conversations | Live website chat, Conversational Email, or other AI powered bots can be powerful tools for increasing conversion rates — but only if they are triggered appropriately and deliver a personalized experience.",

Consider layering in intent data so you can gain visibility into which accounts are close to making a purchase decision, and how much revenue a deal might represent.",
      "However, despite their best efforts, some companies still fall short of achieving peak efficiency and success due to their failure to leverage sales intelligence fully.",
      "Sales intelligenceis the ability to recognize and respond to opportunities in the marketplace. It’s about having a keen sense of what you’re selling, who you’re selling it to, and how they want it.",
      "The more you understand your customers’ needs and wants, the more effective your sales efforts will be.",
      "We’re all familiar with the adage, “You can’t manage what you can’t measure.” But what if you can measure something, but your measurement process is flawed?",

      "One of the most common sales intelligence gaps is a broken sales process.Research shows companies with a well-defined sales process outgrow othersby an average of 18%.",
      "Without a defined process, sales teams are left guessing at best next steps — and those steps often turn into stumbles. And it’s not enough to have a sales process. You need to train your team to use it, and give them the tools they need to easily follow each step.",
      "Here are tips to help you fix a broken sales process:",
      "Lack of consistent & verified data | There’s a lot of information available for B2B revenue teams. But not all of it is accurate. Some data may be outdated, or the source might be untrustworthy. Inconsistent and unverified data can make it difficult for a sales team to draw conclusions about their potential customers.",
      "Asurvey conducted by Gartnerfound that bad data costs enterprise-level companies an average of nearly $13 million each year. The research firm also found that 60% of businesses do not measure how much bad data actually impacts the bottom line.",

      "This could mean losing out on a big deal or missing a subtle shift that completely alters your industry landscape.",
      "Even worse, if you’re not able to identify risks that could damage your business, how can you prepare for them? In short,poor sales intelligence = poor sales performance.",
      "By taking time to review your data and look for trends and patterns, you can better understand what your customers want and how they respond when something goes wrong. This knowledge will help you predict future problems and opportunities, helping you avoid costly errors.",
      "Insufficient tracking across channels & devices | How can you be sure that a lead was influenced by Twitter, for example, or whether it was generated by a prospect visiting your website after viewing a display ad or attending a trade show?",
      "You can’t make informed decisions about which marketing channels are working if you don’t know where your opportunities are coming from.",

      "Many times, tools are missing from the existing CRM that could help you track important information. Other times, you need some sort of analytics report that’s not available — and maybe your company hasn’t yet budgeted for it.",
      "According to aLinkedin State of Sales 2021report, salespeople say sales technology tools are critical for helping them build trust with customers. That’s incredibly important, because the same report shows that while only 40% of customers see the typical salesperson as trustworthy, 89% considered the salesperson they ultimately bought from a “trusted advisor.”",

      "First, let’s establish a shared definition of sales velocity so we’re all on the same page!",
      "What is sales velocity? | Sales velocity is a key performance metric to gauge how quickly and efficiently a company can turn potential leads into paying customers. It tells you how well your sales team performs and whether your revenue generation methods function efficiently.",
      "For example, you may discover that your sales cycle is longer than expected by tracking sales velocity. Identifying these areas for improvement can be a game-changer for your business, potentially leading to increased revenue and growth.",
      "So, whether you’re running a small startup or managing a sales team at a larger company, understanding and harnessing the power of sales velocity can be your secret weapon for success.",
      "Decoding the sales velocity formula | Don’t let the term “formula” intimidate you. The sales velocity formula is a simple mathematical equation that boils down the effectiveness of your sales efforts into a single, powerful number.",
      "Breakdown of the sales velocity formula | To compute sales velocity, you’ll need to consider four essential components:",
      "Now, let’s put everything together. The sales velocity formula looks like this:",
      "Sales Velocity = (Number of Deals) x (Average Deal Value) x (Win Rate) / (Sales Cycle Length)",
      "Sales velocity isn’t just a random number. It’s a diagnostic tool that can help you identify and address any issues inyour sales strategy.",
      "Ahigh sales velocityindicates that your sales team is efficient, effective, and responsive to customer needs. It can also indicate strong market demand for your product or service and a solid understanding of what drives your ideal customers to buy.",
      "Conversely,a low sales velocitysuggests that there might be bottlenecks or inefficiencies in your sales processes. It could also signal that your product isn’t resonating with your target audience.",
      "Deal velocity vs. sales velocity | Is deal velocity the same as sales velocity? Not quite. Let’s explore the differences and when to use each metric to better analyze your sales efforts.",
      "Deal velocity: Focusing on individual deals | Deal velocity hones in on the speed and efficiency of individual sales deals within your sales pipeline. It’s like zooming in with a magnifying glass to examine the details of each transaction.",
      "Sales velocity: Focusing on the big picture | Sales velocity considers the overall efficiency of your sales process, encompassing all deals and opportunities in your pipeline.",
      "Deal velocity vs. Sales velocity examples | Let’s illustrate the difference between these two metrics with a couple of scenarios:",
      "Scenario 1: A slow-starting deal | Imagine you have a deal in your pipeline that’s taking longer than usual to close. It’s been sitting there for three months, while most deals typically close in one month. You’d use deal velocity to analyze why this specific deal is lagging. Is it a problem with the prospect’s decision-making process? Or is there a hiccup in your sales approach?",
      "Scenario 2: Quarterly sales review | Now, picture a quarterly review of your sales performance. You want to assess how well your entire sales team has performed over the last three months. Here, you’d turn to sales velocity to get an overall picture. Are you meeting your revenue targets? Is the sales cycle consistently long for all deals?",
      "Calculating sales velocity step by step | Now that you’re familiar with the sales velocity metric, let’s break down how to calculate it into easy-to-follow steps!",
      "Step 1: Gather data | The first step in calculating sales velocity is gathering the necessary data for each formula component. Here’s a reminder of what you’ll need:",
      "Step 2: Perform the calculation | Now that you have all the data, it’s time to plug it into the sales velocity formula:",
      "Let’s walk through an example using hypothetical numbers:Number of deals:75Average deal value:$800Win rate:30% (0.30 as a decimal)Sales cycle length:45 days",
      "Next, plug these values into the sales velocity formula:Sales Velocity = (75 deals) x ($800) x (0.30) / (45 days)",
      "Step 3: Ensure data accuracy | Inaccurate data can lead to misleading conclusions and ineffective sales strategies. So, before making any strategic decisions, ensure you’re not at risk of any of the following issues that can cause data inaccuracy:",
      "Utilizing a sales velocity calculator | You now know how to calculate sales velocity manually, but you don’t have to. You can simply input your data into a sales velocity calendar! A sales velocity calculator offers several advantages: speed, efficiency, accuracy, and convenience.",
      "Let’s walk through how to use a sales velocity calculator with a simple example:",

    "p": [
      "Meeting your customers ahead of time | Intent data is the key to modern B2B selling. It empowers marketing and sales teams to identify accounts that have started searching for solutions. By flagging accounts as soon as they begin their buying journeys, intent data helps revenue teams begin outreach sooner and win more deals.",
      "But what if you could identify your next customersbefore they start searching?",
      "Whereas intent data allows you tocaptureexisting demand, pre-intent data makes it possible toshapeandcreatedemand.",
      "Both of those approaches are vital pieces of the puzzle for sellers and marketers. When you’re capturing all the demand out there, you’re operating efficiently and making sure you’re not leaving any opportunities on the table. And when you shape and create demand, you have additional control over the opportunities available.",
      "Pre-intent datais information that reveals that an account might be a good fit for your services. The prospect may not be looking for your solutions yet, but they probably face the challenges you help solve.",
      "Taken together, this data identifies the accounts likely to be on the hunt for your services in the future.",
      "Sources of pre-intent data | Let’s take a closer look at the types of pre-intent data you can use to identify potential customers.",
      "If you understand a company’s tech ecosystem, including its current tech stack, what integrates with it, and when contract renewals are coming up,you can predict not only what types of technology a company will be in the market for but also when they’ll start looking.",
      "Additionally, knowing a company just made a tech purchase in your space could be an indicator that it could benefit from your solution, too. This type of data allows sellers and marketers to start cultivating a relationship early, giving them a crucial competitive edge as the prospect enters the sales funnel.",
      "Psychographic data | Buyers have conversations across the web that can give you insights into their pain points and their plans for fixing them. Vast amounts of data from annual reports, web pages, social media, and more can give you signals that a company may be looking to solve a particular problem soon.",
      "AI can sort through all that chatter to pick up on important psychographic data that can inform your marketing and selling.",
      "For instance, psychographic data can help shape interactions between prospects and revenue teams and allow sellers and marketers to engage prospects more effectively with more personalized and relevant outreach.",
      "Market updates | Certain market changes can be significant revenue moments because we know that even if buyers are not in the market yet, they might be in the market when a big change occurs.",
      "Events such as new product launches, leadership changes, relevant hires, funding updates, acquisitions, and events can be incredibly informative for sellers and marketers who want to get into accounts before the competition.",
      "Aggregating this information manually would be impossibly time-consuming, but the right revenue generation platform can do that work for you, offering up prospects who don’t even know they’re looking for your solution yet.",
      "Historical deal information | Some of the best information to help you find your next customer is hiding within your own systems.",
      "Using machine learning and AI, revenue generation platforms (like 6sense) analyze massive amounts of data to look for patterns in your existing customer base.",
      "The software findscommonalities among your best customers— those that signed the biggest contracts, moved through your pipeline the fastest, and are most likely to renew.",
      "Once you know what those companies and deals have in common, you can refine your targeting criteria to prioritize your outreach efforts toward prospects with similar potential.",
      "The stages of pre-intent data | Once you have the right technology partner in place, using pre-intent data falls into these stages:",
      "How pre-intent data improves your ICP | Your revenue team has probably already defined an ICP — a list of attributes that indicate when an account is a good fit for your solution. Things like number of employees, annual revenue, location, and industry are used to create a list of companies that match those criteria.",
      "As we mentioned above, accumulating the foundational pre-intent data that goes into defining a clear ICP manually is all but impossible.",
      "Using the pre-intent data available in a world-class account engagement platform is not only easier, butyields a more finely tuned ICP, allowing you both to see potential customers you might have missedandinvite them into a conversation with your company before they even know they need you.",
      "Understanding and segmenting your total addressable market | Finding your TAM means using pre-intent data to find out how many companies match your ICP. This tells you how many potential opportunities exist for your product or service.",
      "Let’s take a closer look at how to use this data to figure out your TAM and divide it into segments before moving into your GTM strategy.",
      "How many customers are in your TAM? | To estimate your TAM, you’ll need to do some industry research.",
      "The two most common ways to approximate the size of your TAM are the bottom-up and top-down market-sizing methodologies.",
      "TAM calculations are always a game of estimation, but a top-down approach is particularly so.  Using this strategy means using third-party information services (like Forrester or Gartner) to help determine how large your target industry is, and how many businesses within that industry fall into your ICP.",
      "As you can imagine, because this approach relies on general information, it may not accurately gauge the potential of your particular market. Again, it’s an estimation.",
      "The bottom-up approach incorporates that marketing research information again, but adds in your own data. Dividing your total annual contract revenue by your number of customers gives you your average Annual Contract Value (ACV).",
      "Then you’ll multiply that ACV by the number of prospects in your market to find your TAM.",
      "Segmenting your TAM | Once you find your TAM, you can break it into segments that make sense for targeting in the pre-intent stage.",
      "For instance, you might decide to segment your TAM based on general attributes such as industry and company size, or go more granular, grouping based on contracts with competitors or other common attributes your revenue generation platform uncovered in your historical deal data.",
      "These TAM segments will help youdesign personalized and relevant campaigns during the pre-intent stagethat can introduce your brand to prospective customers, creating and shaping demand for exactly what you have to offer.",
      "Creating a go-to-market strategy | Now that you have used pre-intent data to hone your ICP and find and segment your TAM, you’re ready to create your GTM strategy.",
      "Designing a strategy to bring your product or service to the marketplace is exactly where pre-intent data shines. Reaching your selected prospects early with the right message about your brand can build a relationship before they know they need one.",
      "But before you go wide, make sure you’re looking at your current customers for potential offerings.",
      "Identifying demand for upselling and cross-selling among current customers | Looking within your existing customer base for upsell and cross-sell opportunities is one way to increase revenue and grow business.",
      "Analyzing your current customer portfolio may reveal new opportunities with existing clients for solutions you already offer. You can also spot demand for additional services, and weigh the potential ROI of expanding your offerings to meet latent demand.",
      "You’ll find the information you need in your own records. Customer purchase history can help you estimate future interest. And customer firmographic information will reveal patterns you can use to target similar clients with tailored offerings.",
      "Once you have identified potential upsells and cross-sells, you need to create a GTM strategy to promote these products or services. This will involve creating marketing materials and campaigns that target these customers specifically.",
      "By doing this, you can increase the chances of making a sale and growing your business.",
      "Evaluating potential market size and revenue potential | Once you determine the total potential customer base and revenue, it’s time to narrow that down a little by considering market size.",
      "When it comes to market sizing, there are a few key things you need to consider: customer type, product type, and geography.",
      "Once you have this information, you can start to look at the revenue potential of each market. For example, the enterprise market is usually more lucrative than the SMB market, but it is also more competitive. (Sales cycles are often much longer, too.) To size the opportunity, you must look at two things: the number of prospective customers and the average deal size.",
      "As with your TAM, there are a few ways to estimate the number of prospective customers:",
      "Once you have an estimate of the number of prospective customers, you need to estimate the average deal size. Use your historical data, if you have it, or industry averages.",
      "After estimating the number of prospective customers and the average deal size, you can start to calculate the revenue potential of each market.",
      "For example, if you think there are 10,000 prospective enterprise customers and the average deal size is $100,000, then the total revenue potential for this market would be $1 billion.",
      "This exercise should give you a good idea of which markets are most attractive from a revenue perspective and where you should focus your GTM efforts.",
      "After taking these factors into account, organizations can choose between a few pricing strategies:",
      "No matter what pricing strategy you choose, it is important to align it with the organization’s overall go-to-market strategy. If your organization is trying to attract new customers, you may want to consider discounting products or services. Alternatively, if your organization wants to increase profits, you may want to consider pricing products or services at a premium.",
      "Organizations should also keep in mind that pricing strategies can change over time. As competitors enter and exit the market, as costs change, and as customer needs evolve, organizations may need to adjust their pricing accordingly.",
      "By carefully considering all of these factors, organizations can develop a pricing strategy that will help them maximize market opportunities.",
      "Conclusion | Once you have defined your ICP and created your GTM strategy using pre-intent data, you can start using intent data to understand timing and find the best ways to optimize your strategy.",
      "Though pre-intent data can (mostly) be scavenged manually, it would be complex and time-consuming … and produce less comprehensive results. And because pre-intent data forms the backbone of a successful go-to-market strategy, your results will be less than stellar.",

      "Active high-intent prospects (in-market) | An active high-intent prospect is someone who is currently in-market — meaning they are actively looking for a product or service to solve a challenge. For example, they could be reading blogs, downloading product collateral, comparing products on G2, and booking product demos.",
      "A passive high-intent prospect might have aneedfor a product or service, butisn’t actively performing any actionsthat might indicate immediate interest. These prospects could definitely benefit from your offerings, but may not be aware of your solution or ready to make a change.",

      "In early 2021, Qualtrics analyzed their database to optimize growth using 6sense’s Account Profile Fit. From this, Qualtrics learned that 55% of the accounts in their database scored as “weak fit.”(For context, 6sense’s Account Profile Fit assesses the proportion of CRM accounts that match the characteristics of opportunities that have previously been closed/won.)",
      "Further 6sense data revealed that those 55% of accounts constitutedless than 10%of Qualtrics’ deal opportunities. Using this insight, Qualtrics acted quickly to activate a suppression strategy that refocused resources on accounts with the highest likelihood of opening opportunities.",

      "To shake up their marketing team’s processes and deliver qualified prospects to sales, RepTrak brought in 6sense and reaped:",
      "The Challenge | RepTrak had traditionally relied on old-fashioned tactics, a subpar tech stack, and unreliable data for its marketing efforts. The marketing qualified lead (MQL) reigned supreme — and an MQL was anyone who showed any kind of engagement.",
      "Unsurprisingly, the sales team didn’t have much luck converting those leads, and trust in marketing was in the gutter.",
      "“CEOs and board members told me, ‘We think marketing is dark magic. We give you money, and we don’t know where it goes,’” Ali Jawin, RepTrak’s former VP of Global Marketing recalled.",
      "Something had to change — not only so marketing could regain respect and trust, but so RepTrak could increase pipeline, deal value, and revenue.",
      "Finding A Better Way | Jawin recognized a critical flaw in the approach the marketing team was taking: instead of meeting the market where it was and talking about the things their customers cared about, they were talking about the things RepTrak cared about and trying to bring the market to them.",
      "To change that, Jawin knew they’d need insights into what customers actually did care about, as well as where they were in the buying journey. One of the first things she did was to bring on 6sense to get those insights and more.",
      "In rebooting their department’s processes, Jawin and her team found the roadmap they needed inNo Forms. No Spam. No Cold Calls.6sense’s CMO Latané Conant. “It explains what every role on the marketing team needs to do, and that changed everything for us,” Jawin said.",
      "As a first step, Jawin and her team applied this approach to their paid media strategy, and the results were quick and super impressive, with a96% decrease in ad costsand a46% increase in engagement.",
      "They startednetting 3x the pipelinethey’d historically gotten on LinkedIn by layering in 6sense to home in on the segments in which they could provide the most benefit.",
      "In their first six months of using 6sense, RepTrak was on fire.Pipeline quota was 106% of goal, thesales cycle was reduced by 22 days, andtotal contract value increased 64%. Everyone was ecstatic.",
      "Jawin decided it was time to ask sales to start using 6sense too. When the CRO saw 6sense data showing that 93% of opportunities were coming from strong profile fit accounts, he was sold.",
      "So Q1 of the next year kicked off with a 6sense-fueled revenue strategy, and the results were through the roof. Within that first quarter, the team had generated more pipeline than they had in the entire year before.",
      "But then Q2 came, and with it a legacy campaign that required the marketing team to drop everything and focus on it. Jawin calls it a tale of two quarters: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,” she says.",
      "What Went Wrong | The 6sense approach that allowed RepTrak to meet customers where they were with the information they cared about was put on hold. In its place was a massive piece of content that netted some great search rankings, good PR coverage, and tons of initial leads.",
      "But that’s where the payoff ended. First meetings weren’t turning into second meetings. All those leads weren’t engaging. So even though leads were up 245% as a result of this campaign, pipeline ended up down 30%.",
      "Why the abysmal outcome? Because 80% of the new leads were in awareness stage, so they were nowhere near ready to buy. And the content they had created was what Jawin calls “Buzzfeed for B2B.” It was shiny and it garnered clicks, but it didn’t provide the value customers needed at the right stage in their buying journey.",
      "“We tried to move the market to us instead of meeting the market where it is, and that never works,” says Jawin.",
      "The Results | The team quickly pivoted back to the 6sense approach and was able to salvage what had the potential to be a very poor quarter. They ended the first half of the year with 107% of their revenue goal, 100.3% of their pipeline goal, and their contract value up 16% over the prior year.",
      "By using 6sense to understand intent and buying stage, the RepTrak team was able to:",
      "But more importantly, with the help of 6sense, Jawin was able to restore trust in the marketing team and their ability to think strategically and meaningfully drive revenue.",

    "p": [
      "Introduction | There is a fundamental disconnect between what we know about how B2B buying is done and how B2B companies pursue buyers.",
      "B2B buying is done by teams, not individuals. Yet the traditional methods of reaching potential customers are geared to recognize and respond to individuals rather than buying groups.",
      "The purpose of this report is to arm you to make the case for change in your organization. In this report, we detail:",
      "While we encourage you to read the entire report, we intend it as a reference to return to as you progress in evolving your organization.",

      "This executive summary states the argument of the report in brief. We encourage you to read beyond this section to understand the context of the insights and their implications for B2B sales.",
      "The reality: B2B purchases are dictated by buying groups that are typically around 11 people – but can balloon to dozens, most of whom remain anonymous until after they have chosen a winner.",
      "Most B2B revenue teams still do not have mechanisms in place to notice when a buying team, rather than a lone individual, is demonstrating interest.",
      "Why it matters: By the time a buying group member fills out a form on a vendor website, their buying group has likely had hundreds of interactions across the internet and dozens on the vendor website. And by the time a member of the buying group speaks with a seller, his or her buying group has already decided which vendor they would like to buy from more than 80% of the time.",
      "To influence buying groups and win more deals, B2B sellers need to recognize when clusters of individuals within a target account are researching solutions at the same time – even when they are doing so anonymously. This group activity is a the best early-warning signal of a potential deal. But it’s nearly always missed.",
      "We are missing what matters: Many common sales and marketing tools are blind to buying group activity. Worse yet, they may see multiple leads from one buying group as duplicates – effectively stifling the best buying signals available.",
      "Bottom line: Revenue teams that are focused on leads burn precious resources chasing leads that are not part of active buying groups, while ignoring real buying groups that are largely anonymous but will make a purchase. Buying group signals focus revenue teams on the needs and purchase timing of real buyers. Armed with this intelligence, revenue teams can develop relationships with these buyers and turn them into customers at a much higher rate. This transformation can be undertaken in a step-wise manner that includes evolving success measurement strategies.",

      "The rationale presented here is often given as an argument for why organizations need to move to an ABM approach, but in this document, we avoid framing it that way. In B2B today, ABM is considered a demand creation approach for part of a company’s GTM strategy. What is presented here – moving away from lead-centric practices – is universally applicable to nearly all segments of B2B audiences.",

      "Section summary: B2B purchases are made by collaborative groups, not individual buyers. Surveys from Forrester, Gartner, 6sense, and more consistently confirm this. Intelligence platforms Clari and PathFactoryemphasize the substantial size variation in buying teams, ranging from seven up to over 100 individuals, depending on deal size and company scale. While the existence of multiple buyer personas is common knowledge in B2B, this realization is not integrated into core demand creation and capture processes. Shifting from an individual-centric approach to one that better matches how buying and selling in B2B works is vital for an effective B2B marketing strategy.",
      "For most B2B purchases, the buyer is and has always been a group of individuals acting together to solve a business problem. There is ample evidence for this derived from surveys of both buyers and sellers. There is evidence that comes directly from marketing and sales systems, such as marketing automation (MAP) and customer relationship management (CRM) systems.",

In their 2020 study, they found that buying teams ranged from seven to 19, depending on the size of the deal. Content intelligence platform,PathFactory, which captures individuals, both known and anonymous, who interact with content, reported that the number of individuals who engage with vendor website content ranges from 30 when the prospect is a smaller company, to well over 100 when the buyer has more than 1,000 employees.",

For years, marketers have routinely created content and tactics to attract and engage multiple buyer personas in prospect organizations. But they’ve normally failed to build processes that recognize when multiple individuals from those organizations demonstrate interest. In fact, the term “buyer” in B2B is still largely synonymous with an individual person who shows interest.",
      "Section summary:B2B marketing excels at generating interest in the form of web visitors, yet most organizations fail to capture, use, and measure the dozens – even hundreds –of buying group interactions that occur on their digital properties during a buying journey. This failure wastes most of the investment marketers make in generating interest. For example, organizations receive 1.5 to 2.5 leads per in-market account but existing systems (MAPs, CRMs) lack mechanisms notice when this is happening. Business Development Representatives (BDRs), who are driven by lead-conversion incentives, are oblivious — or even hostile — to the presence of buying groups. These challenges not only obscure the organization’s revenue productivity, but also weaken performance measures.",
      "B2B marketing teams successfully generate interest from buying groups within prospect accounts. This interest appears primarily as anonymous website visits and leads. As we will describe in detailbelow, for every lead from an in-market account, there are likely to be at leastfivemore anonymous visitors from the same account. However, 69% of B2B revenue teams have no insight into where that anonymous traffic is coming from (for a full discussion, see thisreport). This gap leads to significant inefficiencies in generating and capturing demand in B2B markets.",
      "Our earlier discussion has already established that the buyer in B2B is a team of approximately 10 individuals. 6sense research has also shown that virtually all members of a buying group do some of their own research. Across all organizational levels and roles in the buying process, each member of a buying group is having more than 14 interactions with each vendor during a buying journey. The result is a treasure trove of buying signals to help identify the organizations that are truly in buying mode. Just as important: These signals help distinguish real buyers from other organizations where one or just a few individuals are demonstrating some interest.",
      "Table 1:Digital and Human Interactions per Person per Vendor by Level and Role",
      "Note: Values in the cells represent the average number of interactions per person per vendor evaluated during a buying journey. Source: 6sense Research, Buyer Experience Study, 2023",
      "With all these interactions, it should not be surprising to learn that most B2B organizations generally receivefrom 1.5 to 2.5 form-fill leads per account that is in–market.",
      "Section summary: Despiteclear evidence that interest from multiple individuals in an organization signifies a strong buying signal, current B2B systems like marketing automation platforms (MAPs) and customer relationship management systems (CRMs) are not designed to highlight this key signal. These systems treat each lead as a unique selling opportunity, missing the big picture when multiple leads show interest from the same account. This leads to a critical gap in recognizing and acting upon the strongest buying signals, ultimately affecting opportunity production and marketing performance metrics.",
      "It is indisputable that multiple individuals from the same account demonstrating interest in a solution at the same time is a stronger buying signal than if just one individual demonstrated interest. However, the systems and processes B2B organizations have been using (e.g., MAP, CRM) were not designed to surface this fundamental B2B buying signal.",
      "Marketing automation platforms (MAPs) treat each lead as a unique selling opportunity, and none have provided a facility to effectively aggregate lead scores within an account.",
      "Customer relationship management systems (CRMs) do not provide this functionality, either.",
      "As a result, most organizations are unaware when they are receiving multiple leads demonstrating interest in the same solution or solutions from the same account.",
      "The crucial job of noticing that an account is showing interest is largely left to the individuals who receive and follow-up on those leads. In most organizations, these are the Business Development Representatives (BDRs) or Sales Development Representatives (SDRs), who are generally the least experienced members of a revenue team.",
      "Even if BDRs do notice that they are receiving interest from multiple individuals within the same account, other factors discourage them from taking the appropriate actions:",
      "Section summary: A tiny fraction of B2B website visitors convert to form-fill leads, averaging just over 3%.PathFactoryshows that 85% to 90% of identifiable account visitors remain anonymous throughout their buying journeys. Even eventual buyers only fill in forms 30% of the time, leaving seven out of 10 individuals who will eventually be customers anonymous. On average, B2B buying groups have 160 interactions with each vendor, mostly being anonymous digital interactions. Resolving anonymous web traffic to its origins offers crucial insights, identifying active buying processes without form-fill leads.",
      "Yet another obstacle preventing marketers from capitalizing on the enormous volume of signals emitted by buying groups is that theform-fill leads discussed above constitute only a minute fraction of the visitors to a B2B provider’s website. Echoing findings from analyst firms and others, more than 500 respondents to a spring 2022 survey conducted by 6sense Research reported an average conversion rate from unique web visitors to lead (completed form) of just overthree percent. This number is consistent with findings from other researchers dating back to 2011.",
      "While website visitor counts include bots, students, competitors, and other non-buyer visitors, evidence from content intelligence platformPathFactoryshows that 85% to 90% of visitors from identifiable accounts remain anonymous throughout their buying journeys.",
      "Further, buyers responding to another 6sense survey – all of whom were part of a buying group that completed a purchase within the past 24 months –reported filling in a form on the website of the vendor they ultimately chose just 30% of the time. This suggests that members of active buying groups are more likely to fill in forms than other visitors. However, that still leaves as anonymous more than two-thirds of the buying team members who completed a purchase.",
      "In all, B2B buying groups report that they have 187 interactions, digital and human, with each vendor they evaluate during their buying journeys. The research suggests that most of these are anonymous, digital interactions (The 2024 Buyer Experience Report).",
      "Put simply, for every visitor from an in-market account who fills in a form, there are between three and 20 or more others who remain anonymous.",
      "Given this, there are two primary benefits to resolving anonymous web traffic back to its origins.",
      "Both anonymous and known individuals visiting the website represent outcomes from marketing activity. Harvesting maximum value from them is the best way to generate return on marketing’s investment in demand generation.",
      "The most important reason to have buying groups at the forefront of the design of a demand generation process is that buying group signals are far and away the most important, reliable signals available for identifying the next best prospects to engage.",
      "Prioritizing buying groups in demand generation is crucial because signals from these groups provide the best clues about which accounts to engage next. Here’s why: Almost every professional, no matter their role, visits B2B vendor websites. Their reasons vary from solving business issues to following industry trends or just exploring out of curiosity. As a result, most website traffic and even form submissions don’t indicate intent to purchase. They simply indicate some level of interest in the subject. While this activity could hint at future purchases, the actions of a single person from a company are not reliable indicators that the account is in-market.",
      "However, if two people from the same organization are researching the same type of content and solutions, it is more likely to indicate an interest of the business, not just a person in the business. And, with every new individual from a company that comes to the website to research the same solution, the odds of that behavior pointing to an active buying process increase.",
      "Section summary: With less than 20% of buying research occurring on vendor sites, B2B providers can tap into anonymous website traffic and other sources to capture valuable digital footprints. Intent data, which aggregates those anonymous interactions, offers a more reliable gauge of company interests than does the content consumption of lone individuals.",
      "Organizations can dramatically increase the number of signals available for identifying active buying groups by harvesting their anonymous website traffic. However, any given B2B provider’s website traffic is just a small fraction of the total volume of signals available. AsGartnerfound in their survey of buyers, less than 20% of buyer research is conducted on vendor websites. Buyers conduct most of their research with industry publications, influencer websites and blogs, analyst firm and consultant content, plus social media.",
      "B2B intent data is the category of buyer signal that encompasses the digital tracks left by buyers as they conduct research and consume content during their buying journey.",
      "Buying groups have hundreds of interactions with each vendor they evaluate, but they have thousands of interactions in total. Some third-party sources, such as syndicated content2 and product review websites, identify the individuals who consume content.",
      "Not surprisingly, however, most buying research on third-party sites is anonymous. As with anonymous website traffic, a meaningful volume of this activity can be resolved back to the accounts from which it comes. When this type of activity from multiple sources is combined, it is packaged and sold as intent data.",
      "Just as with anonymous traffic, intent data is virtually always a record of the activity of multiple individuals from a given company. As such, it is a more reliable barometer of a company’s interests than the content consumption of any given individual.",
      "By itself intent data is not an effective driver of seller activity. It is, however, an effective driver of marketing actions. As will be discussedbelow, intent data provides an early warning system to help marketing target its efforts and ensure that potential deals are not missed.",
      "Section summary: Resolving anonymous traffic provides a significant advantage over relying on individual form-fill leads. The true value surfaces when combining leads, anonymous traffic, and external intent data intelligently. Connecting all these signals and creating one coherent signal from themdemands robust artificial intelligence.",
      "As we have seen, form-fill leads represent a tiny fraction of the signals that are available to B2B providers from their own digital properties. When anonymous traffic is resolved back to its source, organizations can dramatically increase what they know about which companies are truly evaluating their solutions. But the volume of signals available from leads and anonymous traffic pale in comparison to what is available through externally sourced intent data.",
      "The highest value from all these signals is achieved when they are intelligently combined. When combined, leads, anonymous website traffic, and third-arty intent provide an enormously powerful signal for telling which accounts are in-market and which are not. Where prospect accounts are demonstrating interest through all three, organizations should take notice – and action. Capitalizing on all these signals requires robust artificial intelligence, whichwe discuss later in this report.",
      "Section summary: Buyers engage with sellers on their own terms, initiating contact approximately 70% of the way through their buying journeys. Notably, when buyers do reach out, they’ve already determined who the winning vendor will be 84% of the time. Relying solely on form fills risks missing two-thirds of the buying process and engaging too late to influence decisions significantly.",
      "Revenue teams should adapt outreach strategies, recognizing that leads from in-market buying teams have likely already chosen a vendor. Asking new prospects if they were the first vendor contacted can provide crucial insights for effective engagement.",
      "Buyers engage with sellers on their own terms | So far, we have established that buyers are large groups of individuals who emit an enormous volume of signals, which offers the most reliable indication of which prospects are genuinely in-market. And leads – particularly MQLs – represent just a tiny fraction of that available pool of signals.",
      "There is yet another reason to look beyond the lead. Our recent research, corroborating numerous other sources, found that buyers report engaging directly with vendor representatives when they are 70% through their buying journey. For the average B2B buying journey that lasts 11 months, this means that buyers are in month eight of their journeys before engaging with sellers.",
      "Even more, buyers report that when they do engage with sellers, they do so at a time of their choosing:eighty-three percent of buyers reported initiating contact with vendors. Even those that did report that their first direct interaction was in response to a vendor overture engaged at 70% mark of the buying journey.  Buyers are clearly in control of their journeys, including when they first engage directly with vendors.",
      "Buyers engage when they are ready. Even when B2B providers require that interested individuals fill out forms to view content, the data strongly indicate that outreach to these individuals is unlikely to succeed until they have completed their internal research process as a team.",
      "Buyers engage after choosing a favorite for the business | Critically, however, buyers also reported that when they reached out to vendors to begin direct interactions, they reached out first to the vendor that ultimately won the business. Coming more than two-thirds of the way through the buying process, this tells us that when buyers reach out to vendors to initiate direct contact, they have already decided which vendor they expect to be the winner 81% of the time.",
      "Further, 81% of buyers reported that their requirements either didn’t change or changed only slightly after that point of first contact. Buyers have clearly decided what they want and from whom they want it most of the time before they interact with sellers.",
      "Revenue teams that rely on website form-fills to identify buyers run the risk of missing two-thirds of the buying process and 81% of buying decisions.",
      "When B2B organizations receive contact, demo, and trial requests from organizations that are truly in-market, it is overwhelmingly likely that the person filling out the form represents a buying group that has largely established their vendor preferences.",
      "Sellers from organizations that wait for MQLs will be attempting to win over buyers too late to meaningfully influence the outcome.",
      "Tips for engaging leads | Given what we know about buying team members who initiate contact with vendors, BDR and sales teams conducting outreach to leads should consider asking the prospect if they were the first vendor contacted. An answer of “yes” is a strong indication of a potential new customer. When the answer is “no,” the likelihood of winning the deal at this point is low, but there is still a chance. Sellers should consider the potential value of the prospect and prioritize resources accordingly.",
      "Transforming the demand process: Aligning to how buyers buy | To make the most of the available intelligence on in-market buyers, B2B revenue teams need to change their approach to creating, capturing, and converting demand. Many teams use account-based marketing (ABM) strategies. However, ABM alone isn’t sufficient. In the following sections, we’ll outline how organizations should adapt to be more effective.",
      "Section summary: B2B organizations need a clear Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), ideally centered on prospects with potential for profitable, long-term partnerships. However, that’s only the beginning. Effective prioritization requires alignment among all revenue disciplines. Revenue teams should effectively allocate marketing resources by focusing on the small set of accounts in their ICP that are most likely to be in buying mode soon — the In-Market Ideal Customer Profile (IICP). To create the IICP, AI-powered analysis identifies patterns in buyer behavior, distinguishing true intent from the professional curiosity. Going further to identify buying journey stages allows tailored investment and messaging, ensuring effective resource allocation and impactful outreach.",
      "Above all else, B2B organizations must have a crystal-clear understanding of which companies they are targeting. In cases where companies have multiple offerings, that understanding must be extended deeper into prospect accounts to identify which parts of those accounts are the best prospects for each offering. Moreover, marketing, sales and customer success teams must be fully aligned on the definition of which companies are the best fit.",
      "The ideal customer profile (ICP) is just the beginning | Ideal customer profile (ICP) is the term used to define a good customer. Importantly, a company’s ICP should be based on not just which types of companies are most likely to buy, but which are most likely to be the best long-term customers. That may mean excluding some companies that might be easier to sell but less likely than others to remain as customers, contribute to profitability, or help the organization win new customers.",
      "For companies with addressable markets comprising only dozens or hundreds of companies, it may not be necessary to engage sophisticated analytics. In these cases, company leadership often has a clear understanding of which accounts they should be pursuing. For these small addressable market companies, it is still critical that marketing, sales, and customer success be aligned on which accounts those are.",
      "Even more, all three functions must be aligned on where the best potential opportunities inside that set of accounts are. If marketing is targeting companies with tactics supporting one solution, but sales is keen to sell a different solution, simply being aligned on which accounts to market and sell to is not sufficient.",
      "The role of AI in ICP definition | For companies with larger addressable markets, understanding how to segment and prioritize the universe of potential customers requires more sophisticated analysis. There are many methods available to conduct this analysis. The most effective methods employ AI operating against massive data sets to identify patterns that pinpoint which accounts are likely to become and be the best customers. While it may be possible to home in on a narrow set of accounts using standard firmographic measures, advanced AI operating against large datasets can reveal segments and accounts within segments that standard firmographic filtering would not.",
      "The importance of revenue team alignment | At the end of the analysis, however, all three revenue production disciplines must agree about that prioritization. In particular, if sales has doubts about their ability to be successful against the set of accounts identified by the analysis, those doubts must be explored and resolved. In some cases, sales will have legitimate concerns based on their experience, and these concerns must be addressed. It may be that the product, pricing, or competitive positioning must be addressed before consensus can be reached. Failure to do so often results in poor sales performance, irrespective of the quality of the analysis.",
      "Section summary: In the past, B2B buyers relied on sales reps as the primary source for most of their product research. With the rise of online content, buyers shifted to researching solutions independently. While this transition empowered buyers, it hid early buying stages from sellers. Now, abundant online evidence and widespread AI have reversed this, providing crucial insights into early stages of buying journeys.",
      "Before B2B companies had websites, buyer research was limited to trade publications, industry experts, and the provider organizations themselves. As such, buyers had to rely more heavily on sales representatives to supply required information. Buyers had no choice but to engage with sellers earlier, so providers discovered in-flight buying journeys earlier than they do today.",
      "As providers made more content available online, buyers were able to do more of their solution research online. And, as we have described above, from the earliest days of B2B content consumption, buyers have preferred to remain anonymous.",
      "While web-based marketing has certainly simplified the purchasing process for buyers, it has simultaneously obscured the initial phases of the buying journey. This has made it challenging for providers to see early stages of buying journeys.",
      "Fortunately, this disadvantage for sellers has largely been reversed as more of the digital evidence of buying journeys has become available, and as the artificial intelligence required to make sense of these signals has become ubiquitous.",
      "Section summary: In an ideal scenario, B2B organizations would continuously reach all key individuals in their target accounts with relevant messaging. Yet, real-world constraints require strategic budget allocation and prioritization. Knowing the small fraction of one’s ICP fit accounts that are in buying mode (the in-market ICP) is crucial for maximizing returns.",
      "Under optimal circumstances, B2B organizations would have robust campaigns delivering impressions to all key individuals inside every ICP fit account at all times. Under real-world conditions, however, organizations must make hard choices about where and how to spend precious marketing dollars.",
      "Understanding which small fraction of their addressable market is likely to be in buying mode soon is the single most important thing most organizations could know to optimize the return on their marketing spend.",
      "This is especially true because only a small fraction of organizations is in-market in any given quarter. In 2023, approximately 500 B2B revenue professionals reported to 6sense Research that only 9% to 11% of the accounts in their addressable markets make purchases in any quarter (About 10% of Your Potential Customers Are Ready to Buy This Quarter). That means that even for companies that have identified a set of accounts that fit their ICP, only about 10 out of every 100 of those companies are likely to be in buying mode at any given time. Research from theEherenberg-Bass Institute and LinkedIn’s B2B Institutesuggests that most for most B2B companies, the in-market figure is closer to the low end of the range we found.",
      "Further, 6sense research also showed that B2B organizations have only 22% of the accounts that are in-market in their CRM systems (About 10% of Your Potential Customers Are Ready to Buy This Quarter).",
      "Organizations that can prioritize their budget and resources toward the small set of accounts that are likely to be in-market in the near future have a great advantage.",
      "Visibility into account buying stages enables smarter selling | To determine which accounts to focus on, it’s essential to constantly monitor the signals that Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) accounts emit. As we’ll explore, identifying which accounts are actively seeking solutions and pinpointing their stage in the buying journey is achievable.",
      "Section summary: B2B buying and selling cycles both involve stages but are distinct processes, with buying cycles reflecting the buyer’s decision-making process and sales cycles describing the organization’s progress in securing a deal. Buying journeys and sales cycles sometimes run parallel once they intersect, but B2B buying journeys begin well before buyers engage with sellers, typically around two-thirds into their journey.",
      "Like sales cycles, buying journeys in B2B have stages: Awareness, Consideration, Decision, and Purchase. These stages mark milestones on the path to making a purchase. While there are many different models to explain these stages, the key point is that buying groups go through a process to solve business problems. It’s important to recognize and measure this progression.",
      "At each step along the path to identifying a solution, buying groups research across a variety of media and sources. As their business requirements are clarified, buying groups look for the best solutions to meet those requirements, and seek information that will ultimately lead to the selection of a solution.",
      "6sense Research has shown that these journeys require more than 4,000 digital and human interactions by a team of roughly 10 individuals over a period of 11 months (The 2023 Buyer Experience Report).",
      "In contrast, sales cycles capture a selling organization’s progress in winning a deal, marking milestones in the seller-buyer relationship. Sales cycles also have stages, but those stages do not directly correspond to buying journey stages.",
      "Confusion arises because buying journeys and sales cycles sometimes run parallel once they intersect. However, that intersection only occurs when buyers are around 70% of their way through their journeys (The 2024 Buyer Experience Report). As a result, a buying journey lasting twelve months likely corresponds to sales cycles that last only 5 months. On some occasions, of course, provider sales processes intersect with buying journeys much earlier, but our research has demonstrated that this is a rare occurrence.",
      "Section summary:The thousands of interactions buying groups have during the buying journey generate a vast array of third-party and first-party signals, empowering modern marketing teams to discern genuine buying behavior through data. AI can look back in time at historical opportunity records, mapping intent, anonymous traffic, and lead signals to the weeks and months of the buying journeys that led up to opportunities being created. This facilitates precise mapping of the entire buying group journey, supporting targeted strategies tailored to each account’s current buying stage.",
      "It’s clear that B2B buyers have many interactions during their buying journeys, with only a few occurring on vendor sites. For B2B companies, this large volume of data from outside their sites is key. It helps to identify patterns in buyer behavior. This way, companies can tell serious buying actions from general curiosity or research that isn’t related to a purchase.",
      "A level deeper, the way accounts conduct solution research can reveal their position in the purchase process. This identification of buying stages leverages a company’s historical opportunity data, which records recent sales opportunities. Data science then aligns these opportunities with historical intent data, anonymous traffic, and lead information from the same accounts. For a typical five-month sales cycle, this retrospective analysis might cover an additional 10 months preceding the opportunity’s creation.",
      "Subsequently, AI analyzes web traffic patterns, interest topics, and the number of distinct individuals showing interest. These algorithms, working with extensive datasets on buyer research behavior, can identify patterns linked to the phases accounts pass through during their research.",
      "For instance, companies deep into their research for several months might shift their focus increasingly towards vendor website content. As buying teams become more acquainted with this content, their attention may turn to information that compares different vendor capabilities. Such behavioral shifts enable the mapping of the entire journey of a buying group, allowing for the identification of distinct journey stages.",
      "After establishing these models, the behavior of each account within a company’s Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) can be assessed against the model to determine its current stage in the buying journey. For most B2B solutions, we already have ample data to make highly reliable predictions about which buying cycle stage a prospect account is in.",
      "Transforming revenue production with buying journey stages | Because just 11% or less of ICP accounts are likely to buy a given B2B solution in any given quarter, even a reasonably good estimate of which accounts are in buying mode and which are not allows organizations to aim their demand generation and capture efforts at the serious buyers, while reserving lower-cost branding and awareness tactics for the accounts that are not in-market.",
      "However, knowing which stage each account is in allows organizations to further refine their investment and messaging to meet buyers where they are with the information they need. This unlocks a new level of efficiency and productivity for revenue teams.",
      "Having mapped buying journeys into stages, organizations can examine how buyers’ information needs change as they progress through those stages. By examining patterns of keyword data and content consumption, revenue teams can determine which questions typically arise early in a buying journey and which late. Armed with this intelligence, revenue teams can assess existing content and tactics to identify and remediate gaps.",
      "The win-win of precision buying journey-mapped targeting | Providers that precisely tailor content and tactics to prospects based on their needs and preferences as they progress through their journeys simplify the highly complex job of buying in B2B. Revenue teams that excel at this establish themselves as reliable, value-adding partners to their buyers, all the while creating brand and solution preference.",
      "At the same time, this level of precision targeting transforms how revenue teams utilize budget. Rather than spending budget at random across an ICP, revenue teams can now precisely allocate resources where they will best serve both buyer and revenue team goals. ICP accounts that are not in-market are targeted with high-scale, lower cost branding efforts, while those that are in the decision-making stages of buying journeys are targeted with high-value, lower-scale tactics that give the revenue team the best chance to compete for and win deals.",
      "Section summary: The benefits of account-based marketing are well-established but aren’t guaranteed. Without measuring in-market accounts and their buying stages, the benefits of targeted approaches remain unrealized. Many organizations, even those with ABM/X programs, fail to do this.",
      "Many readers will have thought to themselves as they read the preceding sections that this sounds like account-based marketing (ABM/X). Indeed, it should. ABM/X is one approach organizations have adopted to being more targeted about the companies they market and sell to. Most involve,",
      "To be sure, when organizations focus more marketing and sales resources against a well-chosen and agreed-upon set of targets, they tend to produce better results. The benefits of account-based marketing are well-established(see this article for a quick summary of ABM benefits), but they are not automatic. And for most organizations today, the results are far from optimized. That is because most organizations – even those that have ABM practices – have not adapted their demand capture and conversion processes to capitalize on the output of those ABM practices.",
      "Most B2B organizations today, even those with ABM/X programs, do not measure which of their ABM accounts are in-market, much less which journey stage the accounts are in (Doing One Thing, Measuring Another). As a result, most are not able to take advantage of the precision targeting and resource utilization as described above. And most fail to establish robust demand capture strategies to capitalize on their more targeted marketing and sales motions.",
      "Consider what we have established so far about the nature of B2B buyers and the signals they emit as they are researching solutions. When organizations focus more of their attention on a targeted set of accounts, initial success will be marked by two outcomes that most B2B organizations are still not likely to notice or exploit:",
      "Companies that are not identifying where their anonymous traffic is coming from, or which do not have the means to respond effectively when multiple individuals from the same account fill in forms, will be less able to distinguish the truly in-market buyers from those that may be much earlier in their consideration process. As a result, they will squander much of the benefit that their targeted approach has produced.",
      "Finally, ABM/X programs are nearly always implemented as a strategy to execute against a very limited segment of a company’s total ICP. Most potential buyers do not receive ABM/X treatments.",
      "But, unless B2B organizations are selling to businesses with fewer than 30 employees, they should apply the methods and strategies described above in this document to all their potential buyers.",
      "Section summary: Winning B2B deals requires establishing a strong solution preference prior to direct seller engagement. Marketers should provide comprehensive information aligned with buyer information needs across each stage. B2B revenue teams must prioritize relationship-building outside of sales calls through online communities, subject matter experts, and small-group events that enhance brand preference. These strategies are not quick fixes, but contribute to long-term success by building early relationships with key decision makers.",
      "The research into how B2B buyers buy is clear: buyers conduct most of their research anonymously, and they only talk to provider representatives when they have created and ordered a short list of vendors and chosen a favorite.",
      "In other words, marketing organizations must win buyers over and establish a strong preference for their solutions prior to seller engagement.",
      "Enabling buyers at every step of their buying process | First and foremost, what this means is that marketers must enable buying groups with all the information they need to make favorable buying decisions on their own. The organizations that make this information easily accessible and consumable have the advantage.",
      "As a best practice, organizations should inventory both the key questions their prospects must satisfy through the course of their buying journeys, as well as their content and tactics. Aligning content and tactics to specific buyer questions allows organizations to identify content gaps. This content alignment should be completed for key buyer personas. Last, as described earlier, organizations should also ensure that buyer questions and corresponding content items are matched to the best-fit stage in the buying journey.",
      "It is common to find that one or more critical buyer question is either not adequately covered or is attached to a seldom-used tactic type. For example, an organization may have an asset that answers a critical early-stage buyer question, but the asset is a document that does not meet current brand guidelines, uses out of date information, or is simply challenging for prospects to find.",
      "Ultimately, organizations should strive to make finding and consuming all information that will help buyers choose as easy and frictionless as possible. This suggests that as much of this information as possible should be made available to anonymous website visitors. In other words, do not gate any content that might help buyers decide.",
      "When tactics have been deployed, they should be measured for how well they foster engagement from the intended buyer personas at the intended buying journey stage.",
      "Establishing relationships outside of sales calls | Buyers have clearly expressed their preference not to engage in sales conversations until they are ready. However, “ready” for buyers appears to be too late for sellers.",
      "Nonetheless, B2B companies are not rendered helpless. The most effective organizations use a variety of techniques to establish relationships with prospects outside of typical selling processes.",
      "To fully deploy these techniques requires that organizations have clearly identified their in-market ICP accounts. Many of the techniques described below are either expensive to execute, or do not have an immediate impact on opportunity production – or both. As such, they are not quick fixes for revenue production and may not be applicable to all ICP accounts.",
      "However, when executed well, these tactics position the organization as a trusted member of the professional communities in which they operate and allow the provider to deliver value and build brand preference with key decision makers in prospect organizations before and during buying journeys. In this way, the tactics described below increase the odds that a brand and its solutions will be preferred by buyers whenever they go into market for solutions.",
      "Communities | Online affinity communities can be relatively inexpensive to develop and maintain but may require a substantial investment of time. Online communities centered around the common interests of the buying audience, such as functional leadership (e.g., IT leaders, chief marketing officers, office managers), provide a venue for networking, sharing ideas, and giving members a sense of belonging. Through sponsoring such communities, provider companies establish themselves as valued members of the communities they serve apart from simply being vendors. Even more, such communities establish relationships between the members of the community, the brand, and even individuals inside the brand. All of this may play a crucial role in establishing brand preference in the minds of key decision makers in prospect accounts. Care must be taken to ensure that affinity-based communities are perceived as genuine and not as marketing or sales tactics. A clear distinction must be maintained between the vendor, its solutions, and the communities it sponsors. B2B companies establish customer communities. Customer communities do not require a divide between the community and the brand. Instead, they should offer existing customers the same type of opportunities that affinity communities offer, while also building a connection between customers and the brand. As with affinity communities, customer should prioritize opportunities for customers to connect with each other as much as with the brand itself. When prospects are invited to attend customer community meetings, they get a preview of the experience of being a customers. When executed well, these experiences can generate brand preference.",
      "Subject matter experts | Many companies employ known industry experts to create and publish thought leadership content, speak at industry events, and engage directly with buyers who would not otherwise engage with provider representatives. For example, former industry analysts with a history of providing thought leadership on topics relevant to a company’s customers and prospects may be engaged by prospects and customers alike for high-value strategy discussions, even in situations where provider sales representatives are not welcome.rnrnThese subject matter experts can be engaged to speak at industry events and publish content in independent industry publications and online forums, furthering the reach of the brand and continuing to deliver value to prospective customers beyond the confines of an active buying process.rnrnAs with affinity communities, it is important that SMEs and thought leadership content not be perceived as overly partisan. Ideally, both SMEs and published thought leadership will provide value to the buying audience on topics that are not strictly related to the use of a company’s product but will also provide more general guidance to assist the buying audience in their jobs and careers.",
      "Small group events | Where decision makers that are engaged in the earlier stages of a buying process would decline an invitation to a sales conversation, they are often much more inclined to attend an event such as a dinner, wine-tasting, or educational event that allows them to interact with peers, learn, and have pleasant, memorable experiences. Whether employed by the vendor directly or brought in as needed, subject-matter experts may be engaged to speak to audiences at these events, reinforcing the association of the brand with value.rnrnEvents that are more geared to current customers may provide similar opportunities for prospects to engage. Early-stage prospects that would not agree to sales meetings also frequently welcome the opportunity to meet peers, network, and learn more about solutions in a group environment.rnrnIndustry events, long a staple of B2B revenue team tactics, whether sponsored by associations, publications, or analyst firms, provide an excellent venue for bringing early-stage buyers together with vendor personnel and current customers.",
      "Customer advocates | Another powerful resource companies can provide their buying audience is to make customers available to them. Providers may establish a network of customers who are willing to share their time and experience as a customer with potential buyers. Key to providing this resource is establishing a low-friction mechanism for potential buyers to identify customers to speak with. Ideally, buyers will be able to identify contacts without first speaking with sellers.",
      "Section summary: Shifting from lead-centric to opportunity-centric measurement is essential for the success of today’s B2B revenue teams. Our research highlights that focusing on opportunity production significantly impacts revenue, with organizations embracing such measures experiencing an 8% increase in financial performance.",
      "However, only 16% of B2B organizations incorporate these metrics in variable compensation. Organizations should shift their focus to measure how many leads are received per account, and how more buying group engagement leads to greater opportunity production and conversion.",
      "Our discussion has shown that the traditional focus on leads in B2B marketing is outdated. Indeed, many companies now use account-based marketing strategies to overcome the shortcomings of the lead-based approach. However, even ABM-centric revenue teams still struggle to update how they measure success. When old measurement methods are used with new marketing strategies, there’s a risk. Companies might undervalue effective strategies and overvalue less useful ones. It’s essential to align measurement practices with the latest marketing strategies for accurate evaluation.",
      "The flaws in lead-based reporting | When the organization is focused on identifying, progressing, and converting opportunities rather than leads, continuing to focus measurement on lead production and conversion does not help and is often counterproductive.",
      "In our report,Doing One Thing, Measuring Another, we observed that more than half of marketers with account-based practices failed to measure the volume of opportunities produced from their target accounts. The numbers are progressively worse for measuring pipeline and revenue they produce inside the set of accounts they are targeting. Instead, nearly all marketers simply continue to measure lead production and conversion.",
      "We also found that organizations that included at least one of the above measures in the variable compensation for marketers involved enjoyed an 8% increase in company financial performance. This is simply common business sense: measure and reward what you are trying to produce. And yet, only 16% of respondents even utilize these measures.",
      "It is also critically important for revenue teams and senior leadership to understand that focusing on opportunity production may have a substantial positive impact on revenue production, while having no impact on the volume of leads produced. In fact, account- and opportunity-centric practices may reduce the total volume of leads, even while increasing pipeline and revenue.",
      "Further, when organizations apply best practices for targeting ICP and in-market ICP accounts, more of the leads produced will be concentrated in a smaller number of accounts – the accounts being targeted. For the reasons described in detail above, this is a highly desirable result. But for most organizations, this will hurt rather than improve lead conversion rates as they are typically calculated.",
      "Today’s standard B2B lead-to-opportunity conversion rates divide the number of leads that were converted to contacts and attached to opportunities by the total number of leads produced. In most B2B organizations, only one lead from a given account is likely to be attached to an opportunity and counted as a converted lead. An organization that produces three leads for a given opportunity will measure this as a 33% conversion rate. An organization that produces only one lead for an opportunity would have a 100% conversion rate.",
      "Across many prospects, the accounts for which there have been multiple leads will convert to opportunities and revenue at a higher rate, but they will drive lead conversion rates down. Clearly, driving more engagement from target accounts is a desirable result. But our measurement practices punish this outcome (for more,see Forrester’s blog on this issue).",
      "This suggests that rather than measuring the volume of leads and conversion of leads to opportunities, organizations should instead measure how many leads are produced within the target accounts. Where accounts represent multiple selling opportunities, lead production should be apportioned according to the solution and/or buying center they represent.",
      "Once lead counts per potential selling opportunity are in place, it becomes possible to correlate the number of leads produced per account with the performance of the resulting opportunities. When marketing teams know how many contacts per account they must engage to optimize opportunity conversion, they have a clear and meaningful target.",
      "Section summary: To assess B2B demand generation success accurately, organizations must prioritize measuring anonymous website activity, which often surpasses form-fills by three to 10 times in volume. Understanding and measuring this anonymous traffic is crucial, especially considering that most engagement from in-market buying teams remains anonymous in the initial 70% of the buying journey. Incorporating anonymous engagement metrics is essential for organizations to identify genuine interest among target accounts and evaluate the effectiveness of various tactics.",
      "As described above, by far the most prominent, immediate result produced by B2B demand generation efforts is anonymous website activity. The volume of anonymous visitors, even those from high-value target accounts, is typically three to 10 times greater than form-fills. And as the research described earlier makes clear, virtually all the engagement from in-market buying teams will be anonymous during the crucial first 70% of the buying journey. And we also know that only a third of buying group members from organizations that actually execute a purchase fill out a form on the website of the winning vendor (The 2023 Buyer Experience Report).",
      "We have already established that understanding which buying organizations are truly in-market requires visibility into anonymous buying research — both on third-party intent and owned-and-operated digital properties. It makes sense then that organizations should be measuring anonymous engagement for all of their ICP accounts.",
      "Organizations interested in knowing which tactics are driving the most response must measure which tactics are driving the most anonymous web traffic.",
      "Any measure of marketing effectiveness that does not include anonymous engagement is bound to mislead the organization about which accounts are demonstrating interest and which tactics are generating engagement.",
      "Adapting sourced and influenced | Two staples of current B2B measurement strategies are marketing sourced and influenced metrics. These are also the sources of substantial misalignment and infighting between marketing and sales.",
      "Revenue teams must put aside the notion that the only valuable outcome from demand generation is the form-fill and understand instead that even if buyers do fill out forms early in their journey, they are not going to respond to BDR and sales overtures until they’ve made their way through more than two-thirds of their buying journey. Further, we know that approximately 10% or less of form-fill leads ever convert to sales-ready opportunities. Nonetheless, countless BDR and sales email and phone call cadences are executed against these leads.",
      "For all the reasons described above, marketing-sourced metrics that rely on connecting form-fill leads to opportunities are destined to mislead revenue teams about which tactics are truly driving opportunities and revenue. However, it is still useful to identify which tactics induced buying group engagement. Instead of basing ‘sourced’ metrics on leads that make their way onto opportunities, organizations should be measuring which tactics produced the most initial engagement — anonymous and known — from an account.",
      "Identifying first signs of a buying process | When measuring buyer engagement, it is important to remember that B2B providers will often experience a consistent monthly level of engagement from accounts in their ICP. In this case, measuring ‘sourced’ makes little sense. However, revenue teams can identify the moments in time when that consistent level of engagement changed. A spike in engagement – both anonymous and known – often indicates the arrival of a buying process. When that point in time has been identified for a set of accounts, the tactics buying teams engaged with can be identified.",
      "In some cases, the tactics, such as announcements of new products, new differentiating features, pricing changes, and the like, may genuinely be responsible for helping initiate buying journeys. Organizations should clearly identify assets and tactics of this variety.",
      "In most cases, however, the reasons for launching a buying journey are internal to the buying organization and reflect its internal business conditions. The tactics the buying team first engages with will simply be the ones with which they were presented at that time.",
      "Organizations should resist the temptation to credit typical marketing tactics with having sourced opportunities, simply because they were the tactics associated with a spike in engagement.",
      "Timing, more than messaging and creative, is often the key factor in determining which tactics are associated with the engagement of particular accounts.",
      "In our report,Doing One Thing, Measuring Another, we found that even among marketing organizations that have an account-based or target account practice, fewer than half were measuring how many opportunities were produced from those accounts. Measuring pipeline and revenue from these accounts was substantially less common than that. This needs to change. Every organization should report on opportunities, pipeline, and revenue produced for every opportunity within every account that is touched by marketing.",
      "This doesn’t imply that marketing takes credit for the outcomes, but there must be an accounting of which marketing initiatives touched accounts and opportunities, and as described above, whether marketing’s efforts against the account were associated with improved sales outcomes. Over time, teams can measure which tactics were most often associated with accounts that progress in their journeys.",
      "Buying stage | Every B2B marketing organization should strive to maintain a comprehensive record of the buying journey status for every account within their ICP. For B2B companies that sell to mid-sized and large accounts, that accounting can and should be complete. For those selling to smaller organizations, it may only be possible to account for ICP accounts that are actively researching solutions.",
      "There should be a report that indicates which accounts meet the ICP definition, as well as the current buying journey stage for each. Naturally, many accounts will not be currently engaged in a buying journey and would be categorized as dormant. All others should be mapped to their respective buying journey stages.",
      "Funnel/waterfall stages | A funnel is distinct from a buying journey and depicts the state of the organization’s relationship with each target account. As with journey stages, an attempt should be made to map all current target accounts to a funnel stage. And again, most accounts will be in a dormant stage, indicating there is currently no buying-selling relationship.",
      "Under ideal circumstances, the buying stage that most closely mirrors the funnel or waterfall stage is the target or dormant stage. This signifies that if a journey is underway, that is reflected in both funnel and journey stages. Where funnel and waterfall stages incorporate metrics for digital engagement (such as inForrester Research’s B2B Revenue Waterfall), selling organizations should be tracking buyer engagement long before direct interactions occur between buying group members and vendor representatives.",
      "Tactics measured based on tactic goals | When marketing tactics and assets are aligned with buying journey stages – when they have specific jobs assigned – it becomes possible to assess how well the tactics do those jobs. When tactics are all evaluated against each other for how much revenue they are associated with, tactics that engage buyers earlier, but not later in their journeys will always lose out.",
      "Critical tactics that invite early-stage buyers to engage may be very effective and necessary, but will still not be associated with revenue as frequently as tactics intended to help buyers over the last hurdles in a buying process.",
      "The key question is: Which tactics and assets are more likely to be associated with accounts and opportunities that successfully progress through the specific buying journey stage for which it is designed?",
      "Section summary: Marketing success is determined by its impact on revenue production. Key metrics include increased engagement volume from prospect accounts, involvement of more unique individuals in buying groups, and high-touch engagement from key individuals. Evaluate these outcomes collectively without fixating on specific tactics, extending the assessment to early indicators like opportunity creation and forecasted pipeline production.",
      "The ultimate measure of marketing’s efforts is whether they increase the likelihood and volume of revenue production. In other words, if marketing executes marketing tactics against a given set of accounts, do those efforts increase the likelihood of producing revenue? And if so, by how much?",
      "To get there, marketing must measure the volume of engagement from prospect accounts. Then, examine whether greater engagement is leading to better revenue production results. It is important to resist the temptation to focus on any single tactic in isolation, but instead to focus on the impact on revenue production from:",
      "While the goal of marketing is to impact revenue production, it’s important to measure impact or lift on early outcomes. The same set of questions applied to revenue production should be extended to its leading indicators, such as opportunity creation and forecasted pipeline production.",
      "Section summary: Shifting from a lead-centric to a buying-group centric model is a substantial transformation for revenue teams, especially marketing. Tactics marketing has employed to generate lead volume become irrelevant. Emphasizing buying signals and understanding relevant buying journeys helps marketers adapt to the change, ensuring capture of all available selling opportunities.",
      "The changes to systems and processes that organizations need to make in order to move away from outdated, lead-based practices and optimize revenue productivity are straightforward and well understood. The technologies and data required are readily available and mature. And there are countless examples of companies that have already made the transformation. However, despite the clarity and readiness of these changes, adopting them still represent a substantial transformation for most revenue teams.",
      "For marketing: An unfamiliar, more complex target | For marketing organizations that have relied heavily on lead and MQL production, shifting to a buying-group centered model can give rise to numerous important concerns. Marketers experienced in lead-centric approaches often employ two techniques that allow them to maximize lead production.",
      "Neither of these tactics does anything to change the volume of true, in-market buyers that sales receives.",
      "When organizations shift to a process that is based solely on the prioritization of in-market buyers, it is not as easy to manipulate volume. Buyers may be enabled to move through their buying processes more quickly, but it is rare that marketing tactics will be able to substantially alter the timing of the buying process or the number of in-market buyers.",
      "Instead, by accessing all the available buying signals, marketing can ensure that the organization sees all available selling opportunities. And by targeting those accounts with the right messaging at the right time, buyers will be enabled to move through their journeys, and to develop a preference for their offerings.",
      "Here, providing all involved marketers with a complete grounding in what relevant buying journeys look like fosters a sense of confidence. Emphasizing the need to enable and measure stage-by-stage progression will further focus marketers on the job at hand.",
      "Section summary: In B2B, sales often complains aboutlead quality, yet typically just asks for more of them, hoping that quantity can overcome shortcomings in quality. Clear communication is vital as the shift to buying groups surfaces potential buyers earlier. It’s crucial to provide selling teams with buying journey-based reporting, enabling them to track account status and progress.",
      "One of the most reliable phenomena in B2B is sales and BDRs complaining about lead quality. Somewhat ironically, sales teams have, at times, urged marketing to generate more leads, even if of lower quality, in the hope of uncovering a revenue needle in the haystack of curious content consumers.",
      "For teams dependent on marketing for names, names, names, any perceived threat to the pipeline of leads — however poor those leads may be — may be taken as a threat to their ability to earn a livelihood.",
      "To overcome this, marketing leaders must communicate clearly with sales about what will be surfaced and what will not. In the new world of buying groups signals and in-market ICP accounts, marketing will be surfacing many potential buyers much earlier in the buying journey. However, it’s crucial to recognize that these early journey accounts may not be receptive to human outreach, and many of those accounts may not yet be represented by a lead.",
      "Enabling selling teams with buying journey-based reporting so that they can see the status and progress of the accounts they care about is critical.",
      "At the same time, marketing should ensure sales prioritizes individuals who request contact immediately, even if the account does not appear to be in-market.",
      "Section summary: Take a crawl, walk, run approach to shift from traditional lead-centric practices. In the crawl stage, maintain lead production but integrate buying group intelligence for prioritized follow-up. During this time, sales learns about buying journey stages. In the walk stage, BDRs prioritize leads based on account buying stage and begin outbound prospecting to in-market ICP accounts. Marketing shifts focus to opportunity progression and total engagement of target accounts. In the run stage, lead follow-up is halted, concentrating resources on in-market accounts. Marketing emphasizes account and opportunity engagement reporting, replacing lead metrics with leads per account and unique visitors per account/opportunity. Attribution reporting shifts to marketing lift/influence reporting, showcasing marketing-driven engagement impact on pipeline production.",
      "Most organizations are best-served by taking a stepwise approach to the transformation away from leads and toward buying groups and opportunities. This is particularly true with respect to BDRs and sales. This approach gradually introduces the changes that make up the transformation process.",
      "Crawl stage | In the crawl stage, organizations continue to produce and deliver leads and MQLs under current practices. BDRs and sales are introduced to buying group intelligence (intent, anonymous traffic signals, and overall engagement scores) as a means of enabling their follow-up with leads. BDRs should also be encouraged to use that intelligence to prioritize their efforts. For example, where a BDR has two MQLs to work that have received similar MQL scores, BDRs are encouraged to prioritize the MQL for which there is more buying group and intent engagement. In addition, BDRs should be encouraged to multi-thread when they follow-up on in-market accounts.",
      "At the same time, the sales organization is introduced to buying journey stages and buying journey stage-based reporting that shows how accounts are progressing in their buying journeys – and what marketing is doing to enable those accounts.",
      "Where organizations rely on marketing-sourced and influenced metrics, those are still reported, but they are supplemented by reports showcasing the various marketing tactics that accounts interact with as they advance through their journeys. This reporting helps cement the idea that virtually all opportunities are influenced by multiple marketing tactics.",
      "After as much as a quarter in the crawl phase, conduct a comprehensive review of lead performance, comparing the performance of leads from in-market accounts to others. In most cases, this reporting aids BDRs in preparing for the next stage. If the reporting does not favor in-market accounts, then the organization must examine whether appropriate efforts have been applied. It may also be necessary to further examine why in-market accounts have not progressed.",
      "Walk stage | During the walk stage, BDR lead follow-up is prioritized according to the buying stage of the account the lead comes from. Prioritization includes both timing and effort: leads from in-market accounts are handled first, and that more effort is applied to them. Consequently, multi-threading is now required for all in-market account leads.",
      "If the organization does not have an outbound prospecting motion, one is introduced to work with accounts that are identified as in-market, but for which there are no current leads. Because the lead follow-up motions include multi-threading to individuals who may not themselves have been leads, the introduction of this motion should not be entirely new, even to organizations that do not have pure outbound motions.",
      "In the walk stage, marketing still reports on lead production and conversion, but has adopted opportunity progression reports as a primary measure of demand generation success. As described above, these reports emphasize the production of legitimate selling opportunities. Marketing also reports the progression of ICP accounts/opportunities through buying journeys.",
      "Marketing also introduces deeper account engagement reporting: How many leads and how much anonymous traffic were received from each ICP? These reports help demonstrate the relationship between buying group activity, account/opportunity progression and the production of selling opportunities.",
      "Run stage | In the run stage, organizations cease following up on leads unless follow-up is specifically requested. Instead, organizations focus on outreach to in-market accounts. As in the walk stage, some of these accounts will also have leads associated with them, but many will not.",
      "Marketing is no longer reporting on lead/MQL production and conversion and is instead focused on account and opportunity engagement and progression reporting, along with opportunity production for sales. Leads per account and unique visitors per account/opportunity replace lead volume and conversion metrics. Attribution reporting has been replaced by marketing lift/influence reporting that shows the impact of marketing-driven engagement on pipeline production.",
      "Final word: What held us back no longer does | The systems and processes that B2B revenue teams have relied on for over two decades – most notably, marketing automation platforms – were not purpose-built for the reality of B2B buying and selling, as described throughout this document. Marketing automation platforms excel at capturing the interest of individuals but fail altogether to allow observation of the large and complex buying teams that make most of the purchases in B2B.",
      "The ubiquity of these systems has led to generations of revenue teams focusing more on the actions of individuals than on buying teams. This is not the fault of the revenue teams. This is all that technology would allow.",
      "With the wisdom of experience and the intelligence provided by AI, modern B2B revenue platforms make it possible not only to attract and engage buying teams, but to fully capitalize on all of the signals these teams emit as they look for solutions.

      "The B2B buyer is a (mostly) anonymous buying group | Section summary : B2B purchases are made by collaborative groups, not individual buyers. Surveys from Forrester, Gartner, 6sense, and more consistently confirm this. Intelligence platforms Clari and PathFactoryemphasize the substantial size variation in buying teams, ranging from seven up to over 100 individuals, depending on deal size and company scale. While the existence of multiple buyer personas is common knowledge in B2B, this realization is not integrated into core demand creation and capture processes. Shifting from an individual-centric approach to one that better matches how buying and selling in B2B works is vital for an effective B2B marketing strategy.",
      "The gap between marketing output and the value it could be producing | Section summary : B2B marketing excels at generating interest in the form of web visitors, yet most organizations fail to capture, use, and measure the dozens – even hundreds –of buying group interactions that occur on their digital properties during a buying journey. This failure wastes most of the investment marketers make in generating interest. For example, organizations receive 1.5 to 2.5 leads per in-market account but existing systems (MAPs, CRMs) lack mechanisms notice when this is happening. Business Development Representatives (BDRs), who are driven by lead-conversion incentives, are oblivious — or even hostile — to the presence of buying groups. These challenges not only obscure the organization’s revenue productivity, but also weaken performance measures.",
      "Buying signals hidden in plain sight | Section summary : Despite clear evidence that interest from multiple individuals in an organization signifies a strong buying signal, current B2B systems like marketing automation platforms (MAPs) and customer relationship management systems (CRMs) are not designed to highlight this key signal. These systems treat each lead as a unique selling opportunity, missing the big picture when multiple leads show interest from the same account. This leads to a critical gap in recognizing and acting upon the strongest buying signals, ultimately affecting opportunity production and marketing performance metrics.",
      "The buying group is almost entirely anonymous | Section summary : A tiny fraction of B2B website visitors convert to form-fill leads, averaging just over 3%. PathFactory shows that 85% to 90% of identifiable account visitors remain anonymous throughout their buying journeys. Even eventual buyers only fill in forms 30% of the time, leaving seven out of 10 individuals who will eventually be customers anonymous. On average, B2B buying groups have 160 interactions with each vendor, mostly being anonymous digital interactions. Resolving anonymous web traffic to its origins offers crucial insights, identifying active buying processes without form-fill leads.",
      "Most solution research is done on non-vendor sites: The role of intent data | Section summary : With less than 20% of buying research occurring on vendor sites, B2B providers can tap into anonymous website traffic and other sources to capture valuable digital footprints. Intent data, which aggregates those anonymous interactions, offers a more reliable gauge of company interests than does the content consumption of lone individuals.",
      "Summing up the buying signals | Section summary : Resolving anonymous traffic provides a significant advantage over relying on individual form-fill leads. The true value surfaces when combining leads, anonymous traffic, and external intent data intelligently. Connecting all these signals and creating one coherent signal from them demands robust artificial intelligence.",
      "The MQL is too little, too early | Section summary : Buyers engage with sellers on their own terms, initiating contact approximately 70% of the way through their buying journeys. Notably, when buyers do reach out, they’ve already determined who the winning vendor will be 84% of the time. Relying solely on form fills risks missing two-thirds of the buying process and engaging too late to influence decisions significantly.",
      "Demand creation processes must be precision-targeted | Section summary : B2B organizations need a clear Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), ideally centered on prospects with potential for profitable, long-term partnerships. However, that’s only the beginning. Effective prioritization requires alignment among all revenue disciplines. Revenue teams should effectively allocate marketing resources by focusing on the small set of accounts in their ICP that are most likely to be in buying mode soon — the In-Market Ideal Customer Profile (IICP). To create the IICP, AI-powered analysis identifies patterns in buyer behavior, distinguishing true intent from the professional curiosity. Going further to identify buying journey stages allows tailored investment and messaging, ensuring effective resource allocation and impactful outreach.",
      "Why we can (and so must) dig deeper than just ICP | Section summary : In the past, B2B buyers relied on sales reps as the primary source for most of their product research. With the rise of online content, buyers shifted to researching solutions independently. While this transition empowered buyers, it hid early buying stages from sellers. Now, abundant online evidence and widespread AI have reversed this, providing crucial insights into early stages of buying journeys.",
      "Not just the ICP, the in-market ICP (IICP) | Section summary : In an ideal scenario, B2B organizations would continuously reach all key individuals in their target accounts with relevant messaging. Yet, real-world constraints require strategic budget allocation and prioritization. Knowing the small fraction of one’s ICP fit accounts that are in buying mode (the in-market ICP) is crucial for maximizing returns.",
      "Buying journeys have stages – and they’re not funnel stages | Section summary : B2B buying and selling cycles both involve stages but are distinct processes, with buying cycles reflecting the buyer’s decision-making process and sales cycles describing the organization’s progress in securing a deal. Buying journeys and sales cycles sometimes run parallel once they intersect, but B2B buying journeys begin well before buyers engage with sellers, typically around two-thirds into their journey.",
      "Identifying journey stages in the data | Section summary: The thousands of interactions buying groups have during the buying journey generate a vast array of third-party and first-party signals, empowering modern marketing teams to discern genuine buying behavior through data. AI can look back in time at historical opportunity records, mapping intent, anonymous traffic, and lead signals to the weeks and months of the buying journeys that led up to opportunities being created. This facilitates precise mapping of the entire buying group journey, supporting targeted strategies tailored to each account’s current buying stage.",

Marketers should provide comprehensive information aligned with buyer information needs across each stage. B2B revenue teams must prioritize relationship-building outside of sales calls through online communities, subject matter experts, and small-group events that enhance brand preference. These strategies are not quick fixes, but contribute to long-term success by building early relationships with key decision makers.",
      "Adapting measurement practices | Section summary : Shifting from lead-centric to opportunity-centric measurement is essential for the success of today’s B2B revenue teams. Our research highlights that focusing on opportunity production significantly impacts revenue, with organizations embracing such measures experiencing an 8% increase in financial performance.",
      "Measuring anonymous engagement | Section summary : To assess B2B demand generation success accurately, organizations must prioritize measuring anonymous website activity, which often surpasses form-fills by three to 10 times in volume. Understanding and measuring this anonymous traffic is crucial, especially considering that most engagement from in-market buying teams remains anonymous in the initial 70% of the buying journey. Incorporating anonymous engagement metrics is essential for organizations to identify genuine interest among target accounts and evaluate the effectiveness of various tactics.",
      "From leads to accounts and opportunities | In our report, Doing One Thing, Measuring Another , we found that even among marketing organizations that have an account-based or target account practice, fewer than half were measuring how many opportunities were produced from those accounts. Measuring pipeline and revenue from these accounts was substantially less common than that. This needs to change. Every organization should report on opportunities, pipeline, and revenue produced for every opportunity within every account that is touched by marketing.",
      "Lift metrics | Section summary : Marketing success is determined by its impact on revenue production. Key metrics include increased engagement volume from prospect accounts, involvement of more unique individuals in buying groups, and high-touch engagement from key individuals. Evaluate these outcomes collectively without fixating on specific tactics, extending the assessment to early indicators like opportunity creation and forecasted pipeline production.",
      "Managing change | Section summary : Shifting from a lead-centric to a buying-group centric model is a substantial transformation for revenue teams, especially marketing. Tactics marketing has employed to generate lead volume become irrelevant. Emphasizing buying signals and understanding relevant buying journeys helps marketers adapt to the change, ensuring capture of all available selling opportunities.",
      "For Sales & BDRs: The fear of missing out and slowing down lead production | Section summary : In B2B, sales often complains about lead quality , yet typically just asks for more of them, hoping that quantity can overcome shortcomings in quality. Clear communication is vital as the shift to buying groups surfaces potential buyers earlier. It’s crucial to provide selling teams with buying journey-based reporting, enabling them to track account status and progress.",
      "Crawl, walk, run: Meeting sales where they are | Section summary : Take a crawl, walk, run approach to shift from traditional lead-centric practices. In the crawl stage, maintain lead production but integrate buying group intelligence for prioritized follow-up. During this time, sales learns about buying journey stages. In the walk stage, BDRs prioritize leads based on account buying stage and begin outbound prospecting to in-market ICP accounts. Marketing shifts focus to opportunity progression and total engagement of target accounts. In the run stage, lead follow-up is halted, concentrating resources on in-market accounts. Marketing emphasizes account and opportunity engagement reporting, replacing lead metrics with leads per account and unique visitors per account/opportunity. Attribution reporting shifts to marketing lift/influence reporting, showcasing marketing-driven engagement impact on pipeline production.",

      "Buying group signals are the most reliable signals for determining which accounts are in market. | Because only 2 out of 10 buying group members will fill out a form to see content*, every B2B organization should deanonymize their existing web traffic to reveal which accounts are already there researching. | Even with that, less than 20% of buyer research is conducted on vendor websites, so revenue teams must look to 3rd party intent data to complete the picture of which accounts are truly in market. | The combination of anonymous traffic and 3rd-party intent arms revenue teams to effectively enable buyers, while optimizing marketing spend and productivity.",
      "Buyers don’t engage with sellers until they are more than two-thirds (70%) through their journey. | 37% of buyers respond to BDRs or sellers, but 50% reach out proactively when they need to talk | And 84% of the time, buyers have already decided on the winning vendor by the time they initiate contact. | Revenue teams that wait for form fills and conventionalMQLsto alert them to potential buyers are missing deals or getting in too late to influence decisions.",
      "Aligning marketing and sales on an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) of high-potential prospects is essential. | Better data can help marketing, sales, and customer support align around the best accounts to target. | Because at most just 5% – 10% of accounts are ready to buy at a given time, ICP is only the beginning of effective account prioritization. The 10% you really want to identify are those that are in-market – the In-Market Ideal Customer Profile (IICP) accounts. | AI powers IICP targeting by using historical customer data to discern patterns, then compares every ICP account to those patterns to identify the in-market accounts. | Those same patterns not only identify which accounts are in-market, but where in their journeys they are. This enables even more refined targeting and messaging.",
      "The best B2B companies win over buyers and develop relationships long before buyers and sellers interact. | This means making relevant, up-to-date content easily available and consumable across the buying journey and for all key buyer personas. | Even before discovery calls and demos, there are numerous tools available to build buyer relationships, including online communities, industry events, as well as interesting and educational experiences for buying group members.",
      "Focusing measurement on lead production and conversion does not directly improve revenue productivity — and is often counterproductive. | Abandoning comfortable goals and metrics is hard, but the reward is a much clearer picture of marketing’s contribution to deal flow. | ABM-focused organizations that compensate marketers based on opportunity production rather than leads have experienced an 8% increase in financial performance. | Revenue teams should be analyzing anonymous engagement, marketing influence, buying stage progression, and other engagement trends to understand what is engaging buyers.",
      "For marketers, there must be a fundamental shift from generating leads to generating opportunities. | Though it has never been true, revenue teams have treated each lead as a unique selling opportunity. Treating each lead as a unique selling opportunity has led to the false appearance of abundance. | Shifting the focus to buying groups can feel like reducing the volume of selling opportunities. In reality, it is simply focusing the organization on real opportunities, rather than random form fills.",
      "Doesn’t target the best accounts. | Misses most of the real selling opportunities while sending BDRs and Sales chasing after the professionally curious content consumers, and | Leads to measurement practices that fail to capture the value that marketing is producing.",

Thirty-eight percent sell to groups of 10 or more (Forrester) | Gartner reported buying groups of between six and 10 decision makers (Gartner) | 6sense Research findings have been consistent with analyst firms. In two distinct studies separated in time by approximately one year, 6sense found that buying teams average between nine and 10 individuals.",
      "Buying group blindness: Most organizations do not prioritize accounts that produce multiple leads. There is simply no recognition that different actions should be taken and no plan for capitalizing on this glaring signal of buyer interest. | Misaligned incentives: Conventional BDR incentive structures are designed to incentivize the production of a single qualified lead within an account – one meeting for a sales representative per account.[1]As a result, the second or subsequent leads from the same organization are treated as duplicate leads rather than mounting evidence that a buying team is conducting an evaluation. | Second lead syndrome: Making matters worse, rather than being valued as signals of deepening interest, second and subsequent leads from an account are often treated as “duplicate” or “bad” leads. Instead of driving the right actions, they count against the lead conversion rates by which marketing is evaluated. Producing more leads inside a set of target accounts often hurts marketing statistics.",
      "Early buyer awareness system. Resolving anonymous traffic to its corporate origins can alert B2B organizations of active buying processes in organizations from which there are no form-fill leads. | Better lead prioritization. Rather than basing lead prioritization on how much content a single individual consumes, organizations should prioritize leads where there is evidence from anonymous traffic that the form-filler is not acting alone, but is part of an active buying group.",

      "Introduction | How do you identify your target customers? Do you use data, or rely on generalized personas and guesswork? (Spoiler alert: Data gets better results.) | Less than 3% intentionally engage revenue teams early in the buying journey | They conduct nearly 70% of their research anonymously on third-party websites, far from the curious eyes of B2B marketers and sales reps | In fact, many already come to a buying decision before they ever explicitly engage with a company’s sales team",
      "In this guide, we’ll explain how identifying accounts effectively can provide actionable customer insights, reduce sales and marketing waste, and activate more personalized engagement.",
      "It’s hard to take an account-based approach when you’re unable to identify accounts in your pipeline. Much of buyers’ activities online remain anonymous — meaning, you’re missing important indicators from potential customers that are ready to buy.",
      "Account identificationis the process by which revenue teams match anonymous digitalintent signalsto buyers and accounts. It enables marketing and sales teams to segment their audiences more precisely and engage them with the most relevant communication.",
      "With the ability to not only determine who your highest-priority buyers are, but also the topics they are researching online, you can prioritize who you engage when. This eliminates resource waste and increases revenue.",
      "Many buyers in your ideal customer profile (ICP) never visit your website. That means when you can’t detect ICP buyer-intent data beyond a buyer’s personal engagement with your own website and content, you can lose dealsthat you never had a chance to compete for.",
      "How is this possible? Well, B2B buying teams aren’t big fans of marketers and sellers:",
      "But there’s a twist:Buyers create digital “breadcrumb trails” of buying signals as they research. This crucial, unseen data hides in what we callthe Dark Funnel™. Traditional martech systems can’t interpret it, but leading platforms (like 6sense) are purpose-built to detect, analyze, and create actionable insights from this information.",
      "This is particularly helpful since website form-fills — a longtime mainstay of website marketing — aren’t efficient or effective methods to generate quality leads. Website visitors rarely fill out forms. They browse pages to gather as much information as possible before providing their contact information.",
      "And as many salespeople will tell you, even if someonedoesfill out a form on your site, they’re typically not a great lead. Often, it’s an individual contributor (not a key decision maker) doing preliminary research.",
      "A much more valuable cue that an account is ripe for outreach is toidentify multiple buying team members doing anonymous research. But to do so, you need an effective solution for matching activity to individual contacts and accounts.",

      "In addition to IP addresses, accounts can be matchedusing device IDs and cookies. And incorporating other data signals such as channels, product categories, and location can further uncover account data and intent.",
      "Matching accounts to activity indicates who to pursue more assertively. That’s why it’s probably no surprise that a low match rate can be detrimental to your revenue strategy. If an account is misidentified, you’re personalizing messages based on false information, which creates a poor experience for the buyer. It wastes resources, too",
      "Failing to match an account altogether means you’re missing out on hundreds of potential customers and thousands — or much more — in revenue.",
      "How to evaluate vendor match rates | Before selecting a vendor to help you identify accounts, put their match rates to the test. There are a couple of ways to do so.",
      "The firstis to provide vendors a list of known IP addresses and ask them to come back with corresponding accounts. The caveat with this method is that in order to get an accurate indication of match rates, you’ll need a list of at least several thousand addresses — not the most feasible approach.",
      "An easier testis to put JavaScript tags on your website for a week and ask vendors to report back on match rates and accounts that visited the site. This also shows you whether vendors use other data points to match accounts beyond IPs.",

      "But it’s important to know thatAI assistants are not a replacementfor human SDRs and sales reps. They’re not intended to replace any of your existing ops people, processes, or marketing automation tools (like HubSpot, Marketo, Pardot, etc.), either.",

      "What needs AI automation? | Here are ways to identify which tasks can and should be automated:",
      "Conversational email capabilities & use cases | Your hottest leads need the direct attention of your sales team. But that leaves a lot of unattended potential, such as:",
      "All of those leads representpotential pipeline, but who has the time — or the headcount — to reach out to all of them personally?",
      "The need to connect with lukewarm and cold leads is the perfect place to pull out your conversational email playbook. Using personalized automated conversations like the kind seen above, you can offer these potential leads:",
      "When the prospect is warm and responds for a one-on-one connection with your team, your AI assistant will loop in a human sales rep to take over.",
      "Conversational email marketing’s uses are limitless, but let’s go through several example scenarios that can offer your team big returns.",
      "Conversational email & ‘collaborative intelligence’ | Most B2B sellers spend less than 30% of their time doing what they are hired for. Instead, they’re conducting research, collecting data, arranging meetings, and performing repetitive and mundane tasks.",
      "Why not let people focus on higher-value tasks requiring judgment, experience, and human empathy?",
      "Collaborative intelligencemeans supporting human work with AI tools, using technology to manage and streamline workflows. AI is good at certain things, such as performing repetitive, multithreaded work, analyzing huge bodies of data, and handling routine tasks.",
      "Delegating those duties to an AI toolfrees humans to do what they do best: resolving ambiguous information, exercising judgment in complex situations, and building relationships.",
      "Collaborative intelligence combines the best of AI with the best of people — working together to achieve your organization’s goals.",
      "Traditional marketing automation platforms (MAPs) have been plagued with an ugly tradeoff: You can have automation or personalization, but not both.",
      "Automation is great since it allows you to scale your communication with customers, but the messages themselves tend to be generic since they must be written for groups of people instead of to individuals.",
      "Personalization is far more effective at creating engagement, but requires a lot of time for sellers to research specific accounts and individuals so they can then craft bespoke emails.",
      "Hyper-personalized email campaigns can be spun up with a simple prompt, such as “Write me four emails to engage Persona A. Reference the uploaded PDFs and blogs, and suggest value propositions and additional reading based on the account’s intent data.”",
      "Once you approve the output, Email Agents use it to write and send individualized emails to everyone in your audience segment. When recipients reply, the AI analyzes the response and carries on a conversation, offering more resources to aid research and looping in a sales rep when the account is ready to talk.",
      "Email Agents tap into the data you already know about customers. This includes the first-party data in your CRM, persona insights, previous conversations, and intent data signals like the keywords and topics the account is researching.",
      "Email Agents users control how much latitude the AI has for its responses. If you want to use a carefully defined workflow with limited personalization, you can. You can also set up AI Agents capable of autonomously carrying our functions. We recommend creating AI Agents dedicated to specific tasks like prospecting or inbound lead qualification.",
      "We believe AI Agents are the future because of their ability to handle massive task loads with a personalized touch. Within 6sense, we’re already generating 20% of our pipeline using Email Agents. And the tool is rapidly evolving and becoming more powerful.",
      "AI-powered conversational email can effortlessly respond to every inbound lead from your website — and at a speed that even the most efficient human can’t rival.",
      "An AI assistant can immediately start the conversation and offer content that syncs seamlessly with the prospect’s interests — and when they’re ready for a meeting, the assistant can cc: a sales rep to take over.",
      "Leads below the MQL threshold | Marketers often don’t know what to do with Pre-MQLs (leads which are stuck below the MQL threshold). It’s usually not worth your sales team’s time to engage these leads, but it’s not worth outright abandoning them, either.",
      "Your AI assistant can attempt to dislodge these leads from their pre-MQL status by using a content offer via conversational email to optimize engagement.",
      "Low-scoring leads | Low-scoring leads might have recently engaged with your content, but aren’t yet MQL-ready. You can still move those leads through the funnel by having an AI assistant reach out through conversational email.",
      "Content offers | The warm touch of conversational email is a fantastic opportunity to move prospects and leads through the sales funnel by sharing your marketing content.",
      "Your AI assistant can offer — and deliver — ebooks, white papers, playbooks, guides, or any other great content you’ve got, to increase the prospect’s knowledge. (We’ll talk more about conversational email and content marketing in a few paragraphs.)",
      "Accelerate MQLs into SQLs | New MQLs can take a a lot of nurturing. You want to prevent genuine MQLs from slipping through the cracks, but don’t want to waste time pursuing unresponsive leads.",
      "Conversational email takes the revenue team out of the equation but still ensures all new MQLs are worked adequately.",
      "Re-engage dormant MQLs | Your CRM is home to lots of open MQLs that never closed. Why let that previous work go to waste? Conversational emails can revive interest from old leads and convert them to sales opportunities.",
      "For instance, you could re-spark interest by customizing emails for your AI with a new product offering.",
      "Recycled MQLs with no sales activity | Also hiding in your CRM are high-scoring inbound leads that have not responded to, or have not yet connected with, your inside sales team. These leads still have potential — especially if you can offload the task of engagement from a rep to an AI assistant.",
      "Conversational email can accelerate an open prospect’s buying timeframe by marketing the benefit of acting sooner rather than later.",
      "Lapsed leads | Sometimes the revenue team drops the ball, but all is not lost. Let’s say high-intent leads from a webinar were handed over to the sales team, but weren’t touched within 72 hours.",
      "A conversational email designed to engage and convert those leads can “reset” the opportunity by warming people back up before handing them back to your sales team. Just like that, the ball’s back in your court.",
      "Cold leads | Cold leads in your CRM can be re-touched with a personal approach by AI, gauging their current level of interest. If they are ready for more, AI will loop in a sales rep to take over.",
      "Ninety-eight percent of exhibitors collect sales leadsat trade shows. However, less than 70% have any formalized follow-up plan or process in place for those leads.",
      "That’s a massive waste of leads. Following up should be a top priority if you want to close post-event sales. According to Marketo, the first vendor to email leads after events getsa 3x higher click-to-open ratethan the third vendor.",
      "Registration | You can drive registrations to your webinars or virtual events by issuing personalized invitations via conversational email. This is a low-pressure, high-value way to initiate conversations with unresponsive leads.",
      "Your AI assistant will reach out to your leads (with emails you’ve crafted) and automatically register them for the event when a lead replies, “I’m interested.”",
      "Follow-up | Events and webinars can generate great leads — too many, sometimes. We all know timing in post-event follow-up is key, but sales teams can’t always contact every attendee personally.",
      "And just because someone attended a webinar doesn’t make them an MQL. But given that they’ve raised their hand by attending, the odds of being able to make a big impact with immediate outreach greatly improve.",
      "Conversational email meets the time-sensitive needs of follow-up without unreasonable demands on your sales team. A post-event content offer from your AI assistant supports the event’s goals and is an easy way to increase the knowledge and interest of even low-intent leads.",
      "Example scenario 4: For free-trial conversions | Many SaaS businesses use free trials to attract leads. But many of those leads remain undecided or give no indication of their interest. Without follow-up, these leads turn cold and end up forgotten in CRMs.",
      "AI assistants can automatically connect with free trial users via conversational email and ask if they are interested in learning more about the product. When a lead is ready, the AI sales assistant will route the lead to the sales team.",
      "If your organization has cold free trial users, your AI assistant can reconnect with them via conversational marketing too, offering news on updates and changes to the product, or value-adds such as custom demos.",
      "Example scenario 5: For using content to get qualified sales meetings | Content marketing is great for attracting leads, especially when you have a great content offer like a well-researched report or solid case studies. But not every lead who downloads a content offer is a potential customer. Some want the information for their own research purposes, while others are tire-kickers who never buy.",
      "Unfortunately, many B2B tech companies don’t have an effective way of identifying genuine potential buyers that come via content offers.",
      "AI assistants can follow up with anyone who downloads content to start a conversation. They can offer — and deliver — additional complementary resources and answer basic questions to evaluate interest.",
      "By the time the lead is ready to request a meeting, the assistant will already have valuable information to help sales evaluate the lead and offer the right information at the right time.",
      "This is one of the special capabilities of 6sense’s Email Agents, andit allows you to influence buyers from the very beginning of their research.",
      "6sense starts capturing these signals as soon as an account begins its buying journey, when initial members of a buying team have just begun researching solutions.",
      "These intent signals can be used to trigger outreach by Email Agents to key members of the account’s buying team. Email Agents can offer resources and guidance tailored to buying stage and contact persona.",
      "Example scenario 7: Customer expansion | Intent signals apply to your existing customers, too. Keyword research patterns and firmographic data can reveal upsell and cross-sell opportunities.",
      "If customers are searching for additional services thatyou could provide, Email Agents can catch the intent signal, introduce the customer to the solution you offer, and set up a meeting with their account executive.",
      "If a customer is bumping up against seat limits or the upper end of a service tier, Email Agents can reach out to see if the customer would like to discuss upgrading.",
      "Example scenario 8: Maximizing the power of a lean team | Look at examples 1-7. Every single one of those use cases is designed to help you reach all opportunities and have the best chance of converting them into customers. But complex B2B deals are made between people.",
      "Sales teams spend most of their day doing research and mundane tasks like data entry, and less than 30% of their day talking to potential customers. Do all those other tasks have to be done? Yes,of course they do. But do they have to be done by humans?Heck, no.",
      "Email Agents can take a massive burden off your team’s shoulders, acting as a Virtual BDR that handles the digital grunt work and helps the humans stay focused on the humans.",
      "5 biggest challenges conversational email tools can solve | Martech can feel miraculous. It offers revenue teams the ability to deliver effective campaigns at a scale they never would be able to achieve manually.",
      "But it can also come with its own onerous set of management tasks that take time away from other, more valuable work.",
      "Here are five ways AI-powered conversation email tools can boost your revenue teams’ productivity:",
      "Segmented email campaigns register50% higher CTRsthan untargeted campaigns. However, manually segmenting your email list and keeping track of customer interactions is a time-consuming and tedious task that can quickly become unmanageable as your list size grows.",
      "AI-powered email marketing automation tools eliminate this challenge by automatically segmenting your list based on customer behavior, interests, and demographics. AI can also help you keep track of customer interactions and automatically update your segments in real time.",
      "Since AI-powered dynamic segmentation leverages customer data, it’s also more accurate than manual segmentation, which often relies on hunches and guesswork.",
      "2. Content creation & personalization | Addressing your audience by name, referencing their specific pain points, and tailoring your content to their interests increases open rates and CTRs by up to 35%, resulting in deeper engagement and more sales opportunities.",
      "But content personalization doesn’t mean inserting %FIRST NAME% in an email template. To drive the best results, your emails should be tailored to your prospect’s:",
      "Business development representatives and sales reps rarely deliver this level of detail in emails because they …",
      "Email Agents can analyze the latest data about each customer and deliver content that is tailored to their specific needs. It can also understand replies and continue the conversation until the account is ready to talk to a sales rep.",
      "Handling all of this top-of-funnel outreach allows companies to capture more opportunities without devoting massive labor hours to what can feel, at times, like a thankless chore. You’re not going to ruin the AI’s morale. You can, however, boost your human team’s morale by freeing them to spend more time building relationships and closing deals.",
      "3. Email delivery & subject line optimization | The best email content in the world is meaningless if the recipient never opens the message.",
      "AI can look at the interaction habits of individual contacts and determine when each contact is most likely to open and respond to your email.",
      "It can craft subject lines for each contact, and learn which messages they read, and track engagement to improve and optimize over time.",
      "Email Agents also incorporate best practices to avoid triggering spam filters. This includes:",
      "The AI Email Assistant can also show you why emails occasionally bounce, which can help you update and maintain clean lists.",
      "4. Campaign monitoring & insights | AI-powered conversational email platforms can provide valuable analytics to marketing and sales teams, helping you identify trends and patterns in customer behavior.",
      "For marketers, these insights help you quickly A/B test new campaign tactics to drive pipeline growth.",
      "For sales representatives, AI can deliver granular insights into which accounts are becoming more engaged with content, and which topics have their interest. Once an account qualifies for outreach, you’ll be armed with great talking points.",
      "5. Lead nurturing & sales cycle shortening | B2B sales cycles can be really long. When customers are investing in a complex service or product for their business, they do a lot of research. Your emails should enable as much of this research as possible and make it easy for customers to connect with a sales rep when they are ready.",
      "By providing specific content tailored to individual customers’ needs, AI can help speed up the research process. And better-informed prospects become closed deals much faster.",
      "Conversational email improves B2B sales rates | Marketing in the B2B sector often focuses on lead generation. But here’s a challenge most sellers face on the daily:",
      "You must keep your pipeline full of prospects — but in the process, you risk pulling attention away from other critical metrics, like conversion rates.",
      "Without the right tools, those tasks can become a quagmire of manual activities that make it impossible to track every lead and prioritize the ones most likely to convert.",
      "An AI-powered conversational email assistant can help your sales team with a variety of functions designed to save time and improve engagement. Here’s how.",
      "Quickly respond to B2B leads | B2B buyers are accustomed to getting what they want when they want it. As we mentioned earlier, when revenue teams take too long to respond to buyer engagement (such as a Contact Us inbound), those buyers bolt in favor of other solutions.",
      "When a potential customer makes contact, your AI assistant can trigger an instant response in the form of a personalized email, informed by captured data. You can also set up priority-based alerts to make further contact with the prospects who’re most likely to purchase.",
      "Prequalify leads for you | Prequalification is necessary, but it’s often time-consuming and forces salespeople to disrupt their productive workflows. AI-powered email assistants can take manual tasks out of your hands with an automatic reply to potential customers. Your AI email assistant will:",
      "Three out of four B2B marketersagree that personalization enhances the engagement rate, but we all know that personalizing content at scale is tricky. Response templates are available for practically every situation, but they usually sound generic … and buyers can easily spot a too-broad “canned” response.",
      "AI assistants can tap into data you’ve already collected about the customer, enabling the software to near-instantly craft emails that speak to the person and their unique concerns, not just the opportunity you’re trying to offer.",
      "These tools can work with your writing style to speed up repetitive text like greetings and allow you to concentrate on informative, communicative writing.",
      "Proactive outreach | Even with a robust CRM, it’s easy to let leads fall through the cracks.",
      "A contact in your CRM who only gets one or two touches and fails to respond may never be worked again until they’re moved into a “dead” or “inactive” status. This type of delayed contact could be too late to convert hesitant leads.",
      "A similar process enables the AI assistant to engage contacts that failed to respond to earlier contact. This additional engagement can provide additional resources or lead to an appointment for more detailed communication with a sales rep.",
      "When you automate communication processes that take place early in the sales funnel, you can effectively — and practically effortlessly — address your prospects’ pain points and concentrate on buyers ready to convert.",
      "Neglected leads are leads sitting in your database with no sales activity. No matter where the leads come from — webinars, events, free trials, recycled MQLs, ebook downloads, old closed-lost opportunities due to “no decision,” etc. — youdidspend time and money acquiring them.",
      "Neglected leads are a silent, massive problem for demand generation and marketing operations teams.",
      "Understanding the root cause of neglected leads | Most companies have a ton of revenue potential locked up in neglected leads, and here’s why: reps hate working them.",
      "It’s not because salespeople are lazy. It’s because working on low-propensity leads is not a good use of their selling time.",
      "If you want to fix the issue once and for all, you need to ensure that lead measurement starts when a buyer is ready to have a conversation with your sales team. Fortunately, this is another place AI-powered conversational tools can save the day.",
      "Traditional vs. automated lead conversion | Traditional lead conversion systems use lead scoring and manual lead assignment to prompt humans to follow up.",
      "Automated lead conversion systems help marketing teams engage, qualify, and follow up contextually with leads, with the single-minded goal of surfacing those that are ready for a conversation to pass to the sales team. The best AI assistants, which power conversational email systems, can do this work for you.",
      "Some systems also take care of the back end: routing information to the right sales reps, scheduling meetings, collecting conversational data, and piping data between applications.",
      "And here’s the best part — instead of a traditional system where marketers and sales reps are doing that work manually, automated lead conversion systems can make all of those tasks happen automatically in the background.",
      "Why you should use automated lead conversion systems | There are three main reasons every marketing and demand generation team should consider implementing an AI-powered conversational email solution that can automatically convert leads:",
      "1. ROI on marketing budget | Marketing budgets are tight right now. Every single dollar is being scrutinized for ROI.",
      "Automated lead conversion systems ensure you get maximum yield from your marketing programs by allowing you to maintain close to 100% coverage on neglected leads.",
      "2. Closing the loop on marketing attribution | When the coverage of MQLs being worked on by sales is so uneven, how can marketers know which channels definitively have higher ROI than others?",
      "For instance: If a trade-show event fails at generating pipeline and revenue, was it (a) because your marketing team did a bad job, (b) trade shows don’t work for your business, or (c) sales didn’t have time to work the trade-show leads?",
      "This uncertainty skews your data, and makes it hard to understand which channels to focus on and how to optimize your acquisition cost.",
      "3. Control | Automated lead conversion systems put marketing back in control over the leads they generate. With these systems in place, marketing can tell sales, “You can just focus on your sales meetings and having lots of conversations. We’ll do the rest.”",
      "3 ways sales reps can use conversational AI to generate more authentic emails | B2B email marketing is a delicate balance of effort, time, and results:",
      "By smartly leveraging AI to craft your emails, it’s possible to grasp the best-possible benefits of both worlds.",
      "Here are three ways AI-powered conversational email can, paradoxically, help you write less robotic emails.",
      "1. Know your leads — programmatically | Traditional email automation has fairly rudimentary personalization capabilities; it’s often used to insert the name, company, and perhaps role/business function into emails, and little else.",
      "This approach simply isn’t specific or resonant enough. To reach buyers in ways that authentically speak to their concerns, you need tools that can read a CRM and generate a comprehensive understanding of each lead.",
      "AI-enhanced conversational email can recognize a lead’s industry, niche, preferences, and behavior patterns through already archived data and createpersonalizedemail campaigns that take all known factors into account, along with a few pre-established strategies created by your revenue team.",
      "This enables your B2B AI to predict the types of content, products, and subject lines that would be the most interesting to each individual lead. Better still, your business can do all this without requiring time-consuming analysis from a human sales rep.",
      "2. Personalized subject lines improve open rates | We all know that subject lines inform a buyer’s near-instant decision to read or delete an email. And we also know that most are deleted without a second thought.",
      "But personalized subject lines, which are honed to inspire interest and trust in targeted leads, are far more effective than generic subject lines — even well-written ones.",
      "According to anOberlostudy, personalized email subject lines generate an average of 50% higher open rates. But who has time to personalize every email subject line without starting to feel and sound robotic themselves? AI does.",
      "AI-powered subject line personalization analyzes industry and keyword interests to design engaging subject lines for every lead on the email list. The subject lines won’t be the same and won’t necessarily even follow the same format.",
      "Your customers are not cookie-cutter copies of each other. They may work in different industries, vary by size, and have extremely different needs based on their job role. Each member of a buying team has their own concerns and goals.",
      "This means what a buyer might want to see often differs wildly from account to account … and even within each account.",
      "Your conversational email AI assistant can select the right mix of content and topics to keep leads engaged and show that your brand is attentive to their unique business concerns.",
      "10 tips to get the best results from conversational email | After analyzing engagement data across AI-generated emails from our platform, we’ve learned a few things about emails that stand out and convert.",
      "1. Name your assistant | No one wants to have a conversation with “BotAgent5.” Your AI assistant needs a name.",
      "The best practice is to name the AI assistant after an actual living, breathing member of your team. That way, when it’s time to transition to human interaction, your prospect will already have a name they can connect with to build the customer relationship.",
      "If you’re using a digital persona (i.e., you’ve created an email account and profile not associated with an employee) for your AI assistant, be sure to determine whether your use of that persona complies with applicable laws, including state and federal consumer protection rules.",
      "2. Test your content to optimize ROI | Just like you’d do with other marketing emails, A/B test different versions of the same conversational email messages with a sample of your recipients.",
      "Analyze how a single variation — such as subject line, body copy, or CTA — impacts open and reply rates. Changing multiple pieces at the same time won’t allow you to identify precisely what is (or isn’t) working.",
      "Once you’ve found the winning formula, that’s the version you’ll send to the rest of your recipient list.",
      "3. Don’t lead with a question | Using a question in your subject line seems like an easy way to get people to open your email.  However,  our research indicates that audiences don’t want to be challenged with a question right away.",
      "In fact, email subject lines framed as a question have response rates that areless than halfof those that do not (1.2% vs 2.91%), our research found.",
      "4. Use capital letters | Our research indicates that email subject lines with “title casing” of words (meaning, All Major Words Begin with a Capital Letter) have a higher response rate than subject lines with “sentence casing” (Only the first word is capitalized).",
      "5. Know when to quit | Our data shows conclusively that if a prospect hasn’t responded to your first four emails, they’re not going to respond to numbers five through infinity.",
      "The good news: that frees you up to move on to better prospects.",
      "6. You don’t need hyperlinks | Take those links out of your email and the response rate goes up 6x.",
      "Every hyperlink you include is asking the reader to make a decision:Do I click this, or not? Will I finish reading this email, or check out that link first?",
      "In other words, a hyperlink distracts from what you’re trying to get them to do, which is to pay attention to that email and respond to the most important CTA.",
      "7. Timing is everything | Hit your prospects while they work. Emails sent between 8 am and 4 pm have consistent response rates.",
      "8. Brevity wins | Keep your subject line short and sweet (between 4 to 12 words) and your total email length between 51 to 250 words.",
      "Personalize your message by highlighting a persona-based problem your buyer faces.",
      "Make it clear you understand their pain points and offer a fresh perspective on a",
      "better solution to their problem. Customers don’t buy products; they buy solutions to problems.",
      "10. Give them easy homework | End with a low-friction call to action that encourages them to take the next step toward success.",
      "That doesn’t mean asking for a demo. If you’re starting them at the top of the funnel, you should be offering value and education rather than pushing immediately for the deal.",
      "They should get immediate value in return for their time and attention. Whatever they do should move them down the funnel, showing there’s a solution to their problems, and they’ve finally met the people who can provide it.",
      "Conclusion | Collaborative intelligence — combining the best of AI with people smarts — can rocket your revenue team upward toward your goals.",
      "It’s really that easy and that good. Conversational email marketing, powered by AI, delivers results:",
      "Fifty-four percentof executives are already experiencing increased productivity, cost reduction, efficiency, and revenue growth using AI. Offering a better customer experience will be crucial to success in the future of email marketing.",

      "Introduction | B2B businesses spend billions each year on digital advertising, and are devoting increasing percentages of ad budgets to digital efforts. The reason is simple: It’s a great way to reach a targeted audience of potential buyers. | Identify your target audience and engage them with relevant campaigns | Get ads placed where your audience can’t miss them | Effectively measure your efforts to drive positive change",
      "Ad networks, sites, and campaign options change all the time. Your audience changes, too. Interest grows and wanes within accounts, and key decision makers change jobs and move on to new companies.",
      "When you’re spending a hefty part of your budget on ads, it’s critical to be dialed in with the right audience, the right message, and theright timingto reduce waste and generate strong ROI.",
      "This guide can help you understand digital advertising for B2B sales and find ways to maximize ROI.",
      "What is B2B advertising? | B2B advertising includes spending money on your website, digital ad platforms, trade shows, event sponsorships, events, and other initiatives.",
      "B2B advertising is quite different from B2C advertising. Some of the major differences include:",
      "Long sales cycles and the presence of large buying teams makes for a much more complex buying journey.",
      "But it can also represent an opportunity. As more people within an account research solutions, they give off buying signals. Collecting and analyzing those buying signals empowers you tonarrow in on an incredibly valuable audienceof likely buyers.",
      "Identify your audience | To have the greatest advertising impact, your campaigns must reach the right people.",
      "Before creating your intended advertising audience, start by defining yourIdeal Customer Profile (ICP). Your ICP narrows down the type of company that would benefit from your product, based on industry, geography, size, and more. Make sure your ICP includes accounts that are not only relevant to your business and products, but also high-quality and more likely to convert.",
      "Within those accounts, make sure to target members of the buying team who will have a say in whether to invest in your solution.",
      "Get a leg up | With the right account intelligence tool, revenue teams can gather even deeper intent insights for reaching the highest priority buyers, like:",
      "You can then use this information to determine yourin-marketideal customer profile (IICP): a group of prospects that are likely to buy your solution — and buynow.With a defined IICP, you not only know what content to serve certain members of your audience, but you’re also empowered to focus efforts on the most timely opportunities.",
      "Generic advertising leads to lackluster results.Eighty percent of buyers say they want personalized messagesfrom marketers and sellers. You can meet that desire by segmenting your audience into those with common attributes and interests, and then delivering different user experiences that are tailored to the buyers.",
      "It’s not just the ad that should be personalized; personalize the landing page, as well. Put yourself in your audience’s shoes: you wouldn’t want to be enticed with a highly personalized ad that then takes you to a generic page aimed at the masses. The content of the landing page should speak to the same persona as the ad, reiterating and furthering the ad’s promise.",
      "AI tools like ChatGPT can help you come up with ideas for content variations. Try giving it an example of your ad text and asking it to generate five variations.",
      "Similarly, tools like Canva and Creatopy can make it easier to quickly create multiple banner ads for A/B testing.",
      "How much personalization is too much personalization? | Base your content on audience needs, concerns, and stages — and make personalized variations different enough that you can identify what works and what doesn’t.",
      "It’s easy to get carried away with segmentation and personalization. Creating individualized campaigns for all accounts is cumbersome, time consuming, and a nightmare to keep updated. Save that effort for your absolute biggest logos.",
      "For everyone else, take advantage ofdynamic segmentation, which is available within some AI-powered AMB platforms. Dynamic segmentation evaluates real-time intent data and assigns contacts to specific campaigns that match their account’s current research.",
      "For example, you might have campaigns created for accounts that are researching certain keywords, and who have reached specific buying stages. Dynamic segmentation can automatically shift your audience segments into campaigns that match their current research patterns.",

      "Your team has landed on campaign objectives, so ensure the network you choose aligns with those objectives and has the capabilities you need to achieve them. For instance, does it have the features you need to target your audience segments? What about the ad formats to support your creative?",
      "Most ad solutions offer access to a comparable inventory of hundreds of thousands of sites (or more) with similar formats. Once you’ve narrowed your options, consider inventory. Ask the following questions:",
      "The more visibility and flexibility you have within a network, the better.",
      "The most popular platforms for B2B advertising are LinkedIn and Google Ads. Facebook‌ can also be a strong channel for top-of-funnel advertising.",
      "You must have a LinkedIn business page in order to run a Sponsored Content, Messaging or Conversation Campaign. Similar to Google, you’ll select your objective, ad format, and daily budget. Then, you’ll develop an audience by specifying criteria including titles, companies, industries, and even interests.",
      "B2B sellers love LinkedIn because it’s a great place to research potential buyers, and its LinkedIn Sales Navigator platform makes it easy to build lists of leads based on firmographic details, job titles, locations, and other characteristics.",
      "The downside to LinkedIn is that its advertising costs are comparatively expensive. To get great ROI, your targeting needs to be tightly dialed in. Fortunately, a solution like 6sense integrates with LinkedIn and can supplement its audience targeting capabilities by layering in intent data — helping you advertise only to the subset of leads that are likely to buy.It’s a powerful combo.",
      "Google Ads | Google Ads enable advertisers to promote products and services where people are searching for them. Set goals, create text and/or display ads, select relevant keyword themes, narrow your audience within a certain geography, and pay only for results.",
      "Google is the king of search, so using its ad platform to advertise for your business’ most important keywords is a no-brainer. But like most other digital marketing platforms, Google Ads is built with B2C sales in mind. It’s not designed to capture the intricacies of B2B buyer research involving multiple team members.",
      "Here are sometips for optimizing Google Ads performanceby introducing ABM data.",
      "Facebook adswork similarly to LinkedIn, where you can opt for your ad to be featured within the Facebook feed, videos, search results, one-to-one messages, or on third-party apps and sites. Set an objective, select your audience, choose your placements, and enter a daily or lifetime budget.",
      "Many B2B sellers avoid Facebook. The site has billions of users and commands an impressive amount of user attention — but almost nobody uses Facebook with the intention of making B2B purchasing decisions.",
      "But the sheer size of Facebook’s audience makes it a valuable place to generate brand awareness among your target buyers.6sense integrates with Facebook Ad Manager, which allows you to create highly targeted in-market audiences in 6sense, then push those audiences to Facebook.

      "Programmatic Demand Side Platforms (DSPs) allow you to advertise on a variety of platforms from a single interface, which makes it easier to reach your audience without having to individually juggle multiple ad platforms. The ads can be displayed in various formats, such as display banners, native ads, videos, and more.",
      "Measuring ad performance | Your work isn’t over once your campaigns are running. It’s vital you analyze performance over time to see how you’re trending toward objectives.",
      "Determining campaign success | Revenue teams often focus on views and clicks — but what do those tell you about overall business impact? Move from individual contact metrics to those that reveal whether ad engagements contributed to account progression and revenue generation.",
      "Don’t neglect traditional engagement metrics | Influence-based metrics are necessary to drive change, but engagement metrics are still relevant in helping to determine whether your ad budget is being optimized. Here are several to know and track:",
      "Continuously tracking these can clue you in to both the visibility and interest of your audience — particularly if multiple people from the same company are engaging with you (but this requires account-level data).",
      "Analyze and compare engagement metrics for different ads and campaigns to learn what type of copy, imagery, CTAs, and other elements attract your audience.",

      "Not too long ago, ad buyers might’ve said, “I need to reach senior executives working at organizations with more than 5,000 employees, or generating more than a billion in annual revenue.” And then they would’ve found that The Wall Street Journal had one of the highest concentrations of their audience (even though many readers werenotpart of their audience).",
      "Today, audience data lets them target only the audience they care about, eliminating potentially wasted investments.",

      "With LinkedIn, revenue teams can create ads that exclusively target professionals who use Marketo. Or Salesforce. Or who attended Wharton from 1980 to 1988. No other social platform provides this kind of precise targeting for B2B sellers.",

      "But, there is a tradeoff that comes with pursuing an ABM strategy.It’s difficult to scale your efforts.",
      "There’s only so much time in the day for marketing to create a piece of content aimed at a single buyer’s areas of interest, or for sales to create a bespoke presentation for an account. Without the ability toscale an ABM strategy, an organization can’t reap the benefits.",
      "But there’s good news:Today’s savvy marketers and sellers have tools at their disposal to deploy effective ABM campaigns at the scale they need to hit their targets.",
      "Lack of intent data | The main thrust of ABM is to target the companies and buyers that are a top priority for your business.",
      "But because ABM campaigns are resource intensive, it’s crucial to know that all of your efforts will be worthwhile. If you launch a customized, in-depth campaign but it goes unnoticed, did it actually happen?",
      "This pitfall often occurs because revenue teams don’t have enoughintent data. Your ICP reveals good fits for your business, but it doesn’t tell you if those accounts are actually in-market and primed to buy your solution.",
      "…you’re basically launching campaigns in the dark and crossing your fingers that you’ve found a buyer at precisely the right time they’re ready to hear from you.",
      "The more likely situation is that you’ll reach out at thewrongtime, whether too early or too late. Here’s how these scenarios alienate prospects:",
      "Without concrete data highlighting which of your buyers are in-market, you risk sinking your ABM strategy before it gets off the ground.",
      "Even if your company knows which accounts to prioritize for engagement, your strategy will be unfocusedif you can’t measure engagementwith buyers across the entire account.",
      "Because70% of the buying journey happens anonymously, you need the right tools to understand how your efforts influence buyers. They aren’t going to click on every email or fill out a form immediately, so you have to be able to measure engagement in multiple ways.",
      "If you rely on traditional marketing metrics instead of the deeper-level of insights provided by the metrics mentioned above, you won’t have a true picture of the impact of your ABM tactics.",
      "A roadmap for a scaling your ABM program | Now that we’ve laid out the challenges associated with scaling an ABM function, let’s get to the good stuff and look at how you can overcome those hurdles.",
      "With an unlimited budget and employees who never needed to sleep or eat, you could craft personalized campaigns for every one of your ideal customers. But in the real world, that’s not possible.",
      "Instead, the most effective ABM programs save those resource-intensive, high-intensity campaigns for only the cream of the crop (prioritized accounts), while leveraging technology to aid in the rest of their campaigns.",
      "The right ABM platform and technology will give your teams access to all of those characteristics — and enable automation for most of the processes.",
      "Automation and AI are key parts of any scalable ABM program. Instead of wasting time on buyers who aren’t interested in hearing from you, or scouring LinkedIn for your next prospect, a platform with AI and automation capabilities makes it easy for your teams to prioritize their next steps.",
      "Here are the capabilities you should look for in a platform to help your ABM program scale.",
      "Capture hidden intent signals | Intent data is the lifeblood of a successful ABM strategy. This information makes it possible to understand:",
      "For instance, 6sense tracks intent data through a number of different sources including: keyword searches, website visits, review sites, and broader internet activities. Because most of these signals happen anonymously, it’s crucial to uncover who’s performing the activity.",
      "6sense’s industry-leading account identification process matches those intent signals to buyers and accounts across their different devices and channels — creating a holistic picture of their activity over time.",
      "Scaling your ABM efforts requires the ability to capture and analyze intent data.",
      "Dynamically segment your audience | Buyer’s don’t stay static with their activities, nor do they flow through their journey in linear ways. One day they’ll download an ebook, the next they’ll attend a webinar, and then they’ll circle back to just searching for topics broadly related to your services.",
      "Attempting tomanuallygroup your accounts and buyers into lists based on those activities or arbitrary characteristics (industry, title, location, etc.) will result in wasted time and misaligned messaging as they quickly become out-of-date.",
      "Building an ABM campaign based on a static account list is like the tail wagging the dog — inaccurate or stale data is deciding who receives your messaging.",
      "However, by consolidating information across multiple sources like your CRM, MAP, and CDP, you can build lists that reflect a buyer’s stage, website activity, previous engagements, technographics, and more. These sources,when updated continually, enable you to createdynamic audience segmentswhich are always up-to-date.",
      "The true power of dynamic segmentation is that the process runs in the background automatically. A prospect in Europe performs a certain activity while your team on the west coast is still asleep? They’re automatically sorted into the right lists — and start receiving appropriate follow-up immediately.",
      "Uncover the buying stages of your target accounts | Because 70% of the buying journey is happening anonymously, it’s easy to misalign your outreach efforts and messaging with what a buyer is actually expecting.",
      "In traditional B2B marketing, when a buyer explicitly expresses interest in a solution, they’re immediately dumped into an introductory email stream. There’s just one problem with that strategy: The buyer has probably done alotof research on their own, already knows the “101” about your solution, and wants to dive deeper into your offerings.",
      "But when you combine intent data with engagement and historical data about your past deals, you’ve suddenly uncovereda very clear frameworkfor determining where a buyer is in their journey with you.",
      "6sense presents this information in an easy-to-digest and accessible format right on the platform’s dashboard.",

      "While ABM adoption is increasing, measurement practices are lagging, with most marketers still relying on traditional metrics such as leads and MQLs. This reveals a lack of alignment between what marketers are doing (ABM) and what they are measuring. Despite this, there are signs of progress, such as increased measurement of buying group engagement and opportunities from 3rd-party intent signals – measures highly aligned with theThree Principles of Modern Marketing.",
      "Still, these measures aren’t often making it to the board and senior leadership levels. And, marketers also value basic measures like leads and MQLs just as much as those aligned with the Three Principles.",
      "Virtually every businessperson knows the cliché, “You have to inspect what you expect.A variant of that, “You can’t manage what you don’t measure,” supports the same concept.When you are trying to produce a specific outcome, you must measure that outcome, as well as the processes and milestones that precede the ultimate result. And yet, for the second year in a row, we find that there is significant misalignment between what B2B marketers are doing and what they are measuring: marketers are measuring ultimate outcomes, such as revenue and ROI, but are not measuring the meaningful milestones leading up to those outcomes.",
      "The three principles of modern marketing | Last year, we introduced two key principles that lie at the heart of effective modern marketing practices. This year, we add a third:",
      "Principle 1holds that marketing and sales should focus their time, attention, and budgets on mutually agreed-upon cohorts of accounts, which are assessed to be the best-fit prospects to become profitable customers. This principle forms the backbone of account-centric or account-based practices (hereafter referred to as “ABM” or the “ABM approach”). Principle 1 should hold for every B2B organization. Marketing and sales simply must be aligned on the definition of good fit prospects.",
      "Principle 2: Revenue team processes must be to be tuned to identify and engage Buying Groups, Not Just Individuals. | B2B buyers are groups, not individuals, such that the key to effectively identifying in-market buyers is to recognize and respond effectively to signals that buying groups – not just individuals – are actively researching solutions. Our Buyer Research Study found that 92% of B2B buying is done by groups of 3 or more, and 65% of buying is done by groups of 5 or more. Identifying and responding to signals that indicate interested groups is critical to optimizing B2B revenue generation.",
      "Principle 3: Revenue teams must monitor buying groups from each of their targeted accounts throughout their entire buying journeys. | Our recent research on B2B buying processes shows that the typical B2B buying team is having more than 4,000 digital and human interactions over the course of their buying journey, and that they have chosen a preferred vendor prior to speaking with sellers. As a result, we have introduced a third principle, emphasizing the need to measure buying groups and anonymous behavior throughout their entire buying journeys.",
      "Most buyers (84%) have already selected their preferred vendor before contacting sellers, which happens over two-thirds of the way through their buying journey. This underscores the need to monitor and engage buying groups digitally throughout the entire buying journey.",
      "Last year we found that marketers were likely to be employing go-to-market strategies that are consistent with these principles, but much less likely to use measurement strategies that were. We are back again this year to understand how the adoption of modern measurement practices consistent with our Three Principles are trending.",
      "Mapping principles to measures in our study | We asked participants to tell us whether they use each of 15 metrics listed below. Each metric was coded for which of the Three Principles it supports. For example, measuring buying group engagement clearly measures the second principle, aligning to buying groups. It also supports aligning to the buyer’s journey.",
      "Metrics like leads and MQLs produced, which do not support any of the Three Principles, were classified as “legacy measures”. We strongly support measuring the pipeline and revenue that marketing influences, but we did not assign measuring pipeline or closed-won opportunities to any of the principles, unless they were specifically for ABM or Target Account opportunities. We do this because of Principle 1: we view aligning on a set of accounts with sales as a prerequisite to success in B2B.",
      "Last year, marketers reported tracking between six and seven (6.4) of the 14 metrics we asked about. This year, they are tracking just under seven (6.8) of the 15 metrics we surveyed. While the difference in the average number of metrics tracked between this year and last isstatistically reliable, it is modest and ultimately insignificant. However, there have been a few positive shifts in the types of metrics that teams are focusing on.",
      "What has shifted? | Four of the 15 measures included in the survey were designated as “legacy measures”. These include metrics such as MQLs and leads produced, which are not aligned with any of the Three Principles. Each of these legacy measures has seen a decrease in adoption by 10% to 18%.",
      "Several metrics that are aligned with at least one of the Three Principles have also seen declines, most by 10% or less. Two—accounts with intent detected and accounts reached with advertising – have seen larger decreases.",
      "However,several measures strongly aligned with the Three Principles have not only seen significant increases in adoption but are now the most utilized metrics overall, marking a positive shift in metric prioritization.",
      "With84% of buyerspicking a favored vendor before talking to sales, it is clearer than ever that organizations must use intent data to see and react to inflight buying processes as early in their lifecycles as possible. This means identifying buyers with intent, and, of course, measuring that. Similarly, when organizations focus efforts on a targeted set of accounts, it is important to measure whether opportunities, pipeline and wins are produced from them. It is also important to measure whether opportunities are lost within that targeted set of accounts. It is particularly important for marketing to measure as carefully as possible how many deals went to competitors, which were not contested. Finally, because the buyer in B2B is a group, not an individual, measuring the engagement of buying groups is a far better measure of buyer engagement than is the measurement of individual engagement (e.g., leads, MQLs).",
      "We were pleased to see that all three of these advanced metrics are used by a majority of marketers. This represents a substantial gain over the recent past. Nearly 40% of all organizations in our sample measure all three. Individual adoption rates of these measures can be seen in the figure below.",
      "While there has been a shift toward more advanced measures aligned with theThree Principles, the chart below shows that that most teams measure half or fewer of the available metrics that align with these principles. Of the three, the least-adopted measures are those concerning Principle 1, alignment on accounts. This is surprising given the widespread adoption of ABM.",
      "As we notedlast year, marketers are doing one thing (ABM), but measuring another – leads. Still, we are pleased that organizations have adopted half of the buying group-related measures (Principle 2) and over 44% of the buying journey-related metrics (Principle 3).",
      "There are several factors we might expect to influence the metrics marketing teams measure. However, in our analysis, many of the typical firmographic variables (e.g., industry, company size, discipline of marketer) had nomeaningfulimpact difference in the types of attributes marketers measure.",
      "However, the type of funding an organization relies on (private, public, etc.) had areliableimpact on some of the measures. Venture capital (VC)-backed marketing teams, who are also among those more likely to have an ABM program, are more inclined to measure closed won deals and ABM/Target Account Opportunities.",
      "Teams with account-based marketing (ABM) practices measure nearly 50% more metrics than those without, averaging just over five (5.2) metrics compared to under four (3.4) for teams without ABM. Account-based teams are much more likely to use both ABM-specific measures – such as ABM/Target account opportunities pipeline and closed-won deals – and the other measures associated with Principles 1 through 3.",
      "Despite measuring more rigorously than ABM teams, ABM-led organizations still have considerable room for improvement within their own practices. For example, 38.6% of account-based marketers measure ABM/Target account opportunities compared to 7.8% of their peers, however 38.6% still falls well behind the adoption rate of an ABM practice itself (82%).",
      "This discrepancy between the adoption of ABM and those measuring ABM-related outcomes is even more substantial than what we found surveying our community last year. What remains similar is that ABM organizations are also just as likely as non-ABM organizations to measure lead centric measures such as MQLs and leads produced. Account-based teams are simply adding frameworks aligned to theThree Principlesto their existing suite of traditional practices rather than leaving behind what no longer serves them.",
      "Despite mounting evidence that prioritizing individual leads is a failed approach (see our report,The Lead-based Approach Has Failed Us), marketing measurement is still focused on leads.",
      "We encourage readers to explore the interactive chart below for customized views of how measurement varies across teams depending on their funding, ABM status, and more.",
      "Marketers overlook the significance of measures related to Principles 1- 3 | Next, we look at both how marketers use metrics and their opinion of them. Here, we see that account-centric measures (highlighted in the red box below) are not being utilized or considered as important as we would hope. With 82% of marketing organizations practicing account-centric practices, we should see these measures much higher on the scales of both usage and importance.",
      "Figure 6 indicates clearly that while marketers are adopting account-based practices, their measurement practices lag behind. This lag is likely in part due to a lag in what senior company leadership is familiar with and wants reported. It is also likely in part due to marketers not yet believing the more advanced measures serve their purposes as well as the old. Lead-centric measures like leads produced and marketing qualified leads (MQLs) continue to dominate in terms of both usage and importance ratings. In other words, many marketers are still doing one thing (ABM) but measuring another (lead-based demand generation).",
      "It’s worth noting that one’s level in an organization did not meaningfully impact marketers’ importance ratings, indicating a widespread need for a shift in perspective regarding the significance of various metrics, from top management to frontline staff.",
      "Readers are encouraged to explore how the measures’ importance ratings vary across industries using the interactive table below.",
      "Marketers use more than one tool, but the number depends on whether they do ABM | The average marketing team employs multiple tools for measuring and reporting. Those with an ABM practice report using three to four tools while non-account-based organizations use about two.",
      "The three most used tools are spreadsheets, CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems, and sales engagement platforms (SEPs), with spreadsheets being the most widely used among those who do not have an ABM practice.",
      "Spreadsheets, CRM systems, and sales engagement platforms stand out as the most widely used tools among marketers. However, their prevalence may be driven more by availability than by preference. Marketers tend to rate all the tools we surveyed similarly. These minor differences in usage are notmeaningfullydifferent from one another.",
      "All the tools we asked marketers about, from spreadsheets to commercial attribution tools, were considered equally valuable. If a marketer is using a tool, they find it valuable. To explore whether the choice of tools teams use offers insights into the practices and desired outcomes within their organizations, we analyzed whether tool use was associated with a company’s financial performance.",
      "We found that it is. For example, marketers using spreadsheets reported worse financial performance than those that use business intelligence and commercial attribution tools.",
      "We understand that there are countless factors that influence an organization’s financial results, far beyond what we’ve covered in our study, and that using spreadsheets would not cause weaker financial performance.",
      "It is likely that citing spreadsheets as a key performance measurement tool is a symptom of a broader lack of sophistication. Put simply, organizations that rely on spreadsheets might also tend to engage in less sophisticated practices, which, on the whole, lead to weaker performance as a company.",
      "Understanding marketing’s role in revenue production (marketing attribution) | For more than a decade, organizations have wrestled with how to measure marketing’s impact on revenue production. There have typically been two strategies:",
      "Marketing-sourced metrics: an attempt to identify which deals and their associated revenue were first identified or engaged (i.e., sourced) through a marketing activity.",
      "Marketing-influenced metrics: an attempt to measure which deals were not sourced, but were nonetheless touched at some point by marketing tactics.",
      "Both approaches are marred by subjective, dubious, or irrelevant claims about when a deal was identified, activated, or touched by marketing.",
      "One level deeper, we asked respondents to indicate whether each item their organization tracks is measured as sourced, influenced, or both. For example, if a marketing team measures opportunities produced, are they measuring opportunities that were sourced, influenced, or both? As Figure 12 shows, marketers tend to use both sourced and influenced, with equal numbers of marketers reporting use each.",
      "Looking at individual measures | Among the specific measures, it is notable that if a marketer is measuring an outcome, it is likely that they are assessing it with both sourced and influenced measures. Marketers are more likely to measure leads and closed-won deals through sourced metrics, but more likely to measure ABM/Target Account Pipeline deals via influence metrics. Other metrics use sourced and influenced equally.",
      "First touch, last touch, multi-touch | Among practitioners utilizing marketing sourced metrics, there are four primary varieties. These methods apply credit to interactions at different points in the buying journey. Varieties differ in which interactions are given ‘sourcing’ credit. For example:",
      "Of the four, only the Statistical method is capable of reliably identifying the true influence of marketing touches on opportunity creation and conversion. It is the only one that is consistent with This method is the least used. It is notable, however, that where ABM-specific measures are concerned, the statistical method is at parity with first- and last-touch, but registers at about half the usage of multi-touch.",
      "As Figure 13 above indicates, marketers are now more likely to use a multi-touch approach than either first- or last-touch, which are roughly equivalent in usage. While we applaud moving past first- and last-touch approaches, most multi-touch approaches still credit only a handful of touches with influencing deals.",
      "The data (see theBuyer Experience Study) strongly indicate that buying groups have between 100 and 200 interactions with vendors throughout their buying journeys, at least 70% of which are both digital and anonymous. To apply credit to a small handful of those, while ignoring the influence of the others, is unlikely to yield insights that will support effective decision-making.",
      "More importantly, merely crediting form-fill interactions fails to account for the 70% to 80% of prospect interactions that are anonymous. This renders any conclusions based solely on form-fill lead based attribution – whether first, last, or multi-touch – highly suspect at best.",
      "Influenced conversions: tactic, program, or overall | Like the various types of sourced metrics, marketing teams employ different approaches to assess campaign influence. While sourced metrics focus on crediting specific interactions, the evaluation of marketing influence entails examining the broader impact of marketing efforts. This examination may occur at three different levels:",
      "The heatmap below illustrates that marketing teams predominantly analyze marketing influence at either the program or overall level. The presence or absence of an ABM practice does not significantly alter this approach for the metrics listed below. Across the board, marketers appear to favor program or overall level reporting for assessing influence conversions.",
      "Ninety percentof our audience reported measuring marketing return on investment (ROI). We also asked marketers whether they report marketing ROI at the program, tactic, or overall contribution level. Fifteen percent of marketers measure ROI at all three levels. Among those measuring at one level, marketers are slightly more likely to measure the ROI of marketing as a whole than they are to measure ROI at the program level.",
      "Which metrics are reported to the board and senior leadership? | Organizations are often required to focus heavily on optimizing metrics that are reported to the board of directors. And many marketing leaders ‘work backwards’ from board meetings, meaning they build their quarterly priorities around optimizing results that are reported to the Board. As a result, what is reported to the board can meaningfully influence what organizations focus on in their go-to-market strategies. Forty-two percent of our sample reports at least one metric to the Board, but most report two to three (2.4).",
      "This year’s data show thatorganizations are focused largely on the bottom line for marketing – closed-won dealsthat marketing has sourced or influenced (per the highly flawed measurement methods indicated above). Marketers also report theearly-stage opportunitiesthat precede closed-won deals.",
      "Surprisingly,marketing is reporting how many accounts are engaged on the website at a higher rate than pipeline or MQLs. We applaud the reporting of this metric but are nonetheless surprised that it would register reliably ahead of pipeline produced. It is worth noting, however, that there is substantialvariability. We are very pleased to find that MQLs and Leads are clearly second-tier metrics for reporting to the board.",
      "Of the two to three (2.4) metrics that most organizations report to the board, one to two (1.5) are likely to be metrics that align to at least one of the Three Principles. However, it’s important to note that this represents a fraction of potential metrics. Of twelve metrics we asked marketers, just two to three get reported to the board and about one to two of those are metrics aligning to at least one of theThree Principles. Metrics related to Principle 3, which focuses on understanding the entire buyer’s journey, are reported more frequently, yet still account for only about 10% of all available metrics under this principle.",
      "Waterfall models are structured frameworks that outline the relationship between buyer and seller. These models provide organizations with a systematic approach to track an organization’s progress against a set of selling opportunities. Some Waterfall or funnel models track stages starting with the first interactions of sellers with buyers. Others reach further back in time to measure pre-sales milestones – the relationship from the time a set of accounts is targeted through to the time sales begins working an opportunity.",
      "Eighty-three percentof marketers in our sample indicated that their organization employs a funnel or waterfall model incorporating pre-sales activities. If organizations have an account-based program, they are nearly twice as likely to do so.",
      "Marketing teams typically use more than one (1.8 models) of the four types of waterfall models we asked about.",
      "Account-based marketers have a higher tendency to adopt the advanced water fall models (account- and opportunity-based) than the less advanced models (leads-based and sales-only funnels). However, they do use the less advanced waterfall models at similar rates as their non-account-based peers. This reflects a gradual shift towards more sophisticated methods for account-based marketers, as they incorporate new models without fully abandoning the older ones.",
      "The use of opportunity-based waterfalls | Surprisingly, while account-based teams have a higher tendency to adopt advanced waterfall models, they give similar ratings for these models as their peers using leads-based or sales only funnels. Among non-account-based marketers, these teams show a clear preference for opportunity-based funnels compared to their peers using the other three models, despite a relatively low adoption rate (32.8%). Thus, although not widely embraced by non-account-based organizations, the minority that does utilize this advanced waterfall method can hopefully serve as a compelling demonstration of its effectiveness to their peers.",
      "The opportunity is ultimately the ideal currency for a Waterfall or funnel, because it is the most persistent unit of measure throughout revenue processes. Leads are virtually always converted to contacts and attached to opportunities where applicable. And, many accounts represent multiple selling opportunities. The opportunity object in CRM systems is typically capable of accommodating both marketing and sales processes.",
      "How marketers perceive revenue measurement | Finally, given the evolving nature and complexity of measuring marketing performance that has been discussed throughout this report, we wanted to understand whether marketers felt as though the way their organizations measure performance is fair. To assess this, we asked marketers to rate their organizations’ measurement practices from 1 (unfair) to 5 (fair).",
      "Higher fairness ratings are reliablycorrelatedwith tracking more measurements, using more tools, and employing more funnel or waterfall models.",
      "While marketers are adopting account-based practices, in most cases their measurement practices lag. Last year 72% of the marketers we surveyed had account-based marketing programs, yet their measurement focus was on traditional metrics like leads and MQLs, indicating a misalignment between strategy and measurement. This year, the gap appears to have grown even wider. Eighty-two percent have an ABM practice but 33% or fewer measure account-centric metrics.",
      "In other words, like last year, marketers are doing one thing (ABM), but measuring another (leads and MQLs).",
      "Legacy measures are still widely used, but the measures that have become more prominent over the past year are the most advanced measures. Those consistent with theThree Principleshave made significant advances in the past year.",
      "This disconnect between what marketing is doing (ABM) and what it is measuring (lead-based marketing) is likely due in part to a lag in what Boards and senior company leadership is familiar with and wants reported. The findings reported here also suggest that this lag is also likely in part due to marketers not yet believing the more advanced measures serve their purposes as well as the old.",
      "To begin this report, we invoked the business maxim, you can’t manage what you don’t measure. Unfortunately, our 2025 Marketing Attribution and Contribution report finds that marketing teams are still not measuring what they are attempting to manage. Marketing teams should align measurement efforts directly with their operational activities, ensuring that metrics accurately reflect their strategic approaches.",
      "The survey sample | For this year’s study, we surveyed 716 marketers from a panel of B2B practitioners who are not affiliated with 6sense. This is a different audience than we sampled for this study last year. Last year, we conducted organic recruitment, putting out ads for our survey through 6sense’s social channels. Consequently, last year’s sample likely included marketers familiar with 6sense and potentially part of our community. Understanding this subset of marketers remains crucial. However, it’s equally important to grasp the broader landscape of B2B marketing practices. Thus, sampling from a panel of B2B practitioners unassociated with 6sense this year ensured that our data more accurately reflected the diverse B2B marketing landscape.",
      "To understand whether there might be other factors at work causing differences in ABM adoption, we tested a wide variety of firmographic and demographic factors, including the marketer’s discipline within marketing, company size, industry, and more. These factors did not influence the year-over-year difference we observed.",
      "What we cannot say, however, is that these changes are due to a change over time. Next year, we will collect data to do a time-wise comparison for both groups.",

These minor differences in usage are not meaningfully different from one another.",
      "Marketing ROI | Ninety percent of our audience reported measuring marketing return on investment (ROI). We also asked marketers whether they report marketing ROI at the program, tactic, or overall contribution level. Fifteen percent of marketers measure ROI at all three levels.

      "82% of teams have adopted account-based marketing (ABM). | Several measures strongly aligned with the Three Principles of Modern Marketing have seen significant adoption increases and are now the most utilized overall, indicating a positive shift in metric prioritization. | While there has been a shift toward more advanced measures aligned with the Three Principles, most teams measure half or fewer of the available metrics that align with these principles. | Of the metrics we asked marketers about, just two to three are reported to the board and about one to two of those metrics align to at least one of the Three Principles. | Fifty-seven percent of marketers use both sourced and influenced attribution measures, with non-account-based teams favoring sourced metrics. | ABM practitioners are more likely to use advanced waterfall models but rate their importance similar to simpler models. Non-account-based teams rate opportunity-based funnels considerably higher than all others, while only 33% of non-ABM teams use them. | Marketers are now more likely to use a multi-touch approach than either first- or last-touch, which are used equally. Like last year, most marketers do not use advanced analytics to measure attribution. | Under 25% rate their marketing measurement practices as fair. Those using an account-based approach, however, are more likely to give a higher fairness rating. This is partly because these teams typically engage in more extensive measurement practices. | For measurement tracking and reporting, marketers primarily use CRM systems, spreadsheets, and sales engagement platforms. | Although 90% report marketing ROI, ABM-led organizations are notably more diligent in measuring it than their non-ABM counterparts.",
      "Does marketing claim credit for sourcing a deal because the first contact associated with the opportunity was acquired through a marketing activity (First touch)? | Or, does marketing claim credit for the last contact, or the contact associated with the last activity, prior to delivery of a selling opportunity to sales (Last touch)? | Or, do organizations apply credit to multiple touch points (multi-touch)? | The final category, Statistical, applies when organizations use multivariate statistical analysis to determine how marketing touchpoints influenced the opportunities produced.",
      "Program level: Marketing programs involve multiple tactics (see below), and typically have a central theme and objective, which align with the business’s goals, such as drive pipeline for net new customers. Marketers assess the effectiveness of entire marketing programs, such as combinations of email sequences and social media advertising efforts. Here, they are looking at the collective impact of the program(s) on various metrics without breaking down the analysis into individual strategies or tactics. | Tactic level: At the tactic level, marketers evaluate the contribution of specific components of marketing programs. For example, a marketing program may include an email sequence and an advertising campaign delivered to the same audience. The email sequence and advertising campaign are tactics within the program. | Overall: At this level, marketers assess the combined contribution of all marketing efforts across various channels and programs to each metric. In this approach, marketers do not necessarily attribute success to specific programs or tactics but rather consider the cumulative effect of all marketing activities on the outcomes they’re measuring.",

      "She writes: “There’s a built-in disconnect between some of the traditional metrics sales reps and marketers are used to (like cost-per-click and click-through rate) and the reality of how we need to connect with customers and sell today. It’s not that these legacy metrics are totally irrelevant; it’s just that they don’t paint a full picture of how accounts are engaging with our brand.”",

      "In this How-To, we’ll present a list of longtimemarketing metricsand their more insightful, impactful “next-gen” equivalents. These metrics can uncover deeper insights about your buyers and reveal your team’s actual impact on revenue.",
      "Impressions track how many times an ad or social media post was displayed. But it doesn’t mean it wasseen, or if it was seen by the right person at a company within your ideal customer profile (ICP).",
      "Instead,measurereach: the number of unique visitors in your target audience who are exposed to your campaigns.",
      "Click-through rate → View-through rate | Click-through rates tell you just that: the percentage of people who saw your ad and clicked on it. What can you do with this information? Not a whole lot.",
      "In fact, this person could be someone totally out of your target audience simply looking for more information about a certain topic. On the other hand, there may be buyers from your target accounts who view the ad but never click on it. Click-through rates actually bring up more questions than answers.",
      "View-through ratestake this engagement a layer deeper, providing insight into how a particular ad or piece of content influences people to take further action. A view-through rate measures how many people convert on your website after viewing an ad, but not necessarily clicking on it.",
      "When you pair view-through information with a solution like 6sense’s ability to de-anonymize accounts and capture intent data, you get a detailed picture of how your advertising efforts are influencing the buying journey of target accounts.",
      "Cost per click → Cost per result | Clicks don’t indicate a person is ready to buy from you, which makes cost per click also a rather arbitrary measurement of success. A low cost per click may look great on paper, but what does it mean for business outcomes? Did those clicks lead to revenue, or at least deep engagement from target accounts? If the answer is “no” or “I don’t know,” this value is virtually meaningless.",
      "Cost per resultis more specific and flexible, as you can determine the desired “result,” or outcome, such as:",
      "This enables your marketing to be more strategic by allocating resources and budget toward specificactions.",
      "Clicks → Number of accounts engaged | Not all clicks are created equal. Some are unintentional. Some come from wildly unqualified leads. And some come from click farms devoted to defrauding advertisers.",
      "Instead of counting clicks,look at engagement. After accounts see your campaigns, how many begin doing research?",
      "Measuring account engagement relies on buyer intent data that can be tied to specific accounts. Platforms like 6sense can also track how accounts interact with your various campaigns, your website content, and third-party content. That enables you to spot when account behavior shifts, and tie together the factors that influenced the buying journey.",
      "MQLs → In-market accounts | Marketing-qualified leads, or MQLs, refer to leads who have engaged with marketing content and are considered ready to be engaged by sales. The definition of an MQL differs from one organization to the next, and what qualifies someone as an MQL is usually based on hunches rather than data.",
      "The truth is, people engage with content for a number of reasons, like:",
      "So just because someone downloaded an ebook or clicked on an ad doesn’t mean you should start blasting them with follow-up emails or phone calls.",
      "Look forin-market accountsinstead. “In-market” is a term used to describe accounts that match an ideal customer profile and are actively showing buying signals. Whereas MQLs focus on the actions of a single person, measuring at an account level enables you to strategically engage multiple members of the buying team to move a deal forward.",
      "This is critically important becauseresearch shows many different stakeholders are part of buying teams. If you can get multiple buying team members engaged, you can dramatically increase your chances of landing a deal.",
      "SQLs → 6QAs | Sales-qualified leads, or SQLs, refer to leads that have been determined to be legitimate opportunities. Just like MQLs, what makes an account an SQL is entirely subjective.",

      "When multiple members of the same team are researching your brand, that sends a huge signal that the team is serious about purchasing a solution. And with this signal, you’ve got the green light to begin further conversations and outreach with those buyers.",
      "Pipeline attribution → Conversion of accounts to pipeline and revenue | Digital marketers strive to attribute leads to specific marketing channels. But today’s B2B buying cycles can take months and involve dozens of touchpoints. Trying to attribute a contact to a single marketing channel can be a fool’s errand — and a giant waste of your time.",
      "By understanding how your campaignsare influencing accounts throughout their buying journey, you can see which campaigns are nudging them forward along the path toward revenue. This allows you to maintain a broader picture of which efforts are andaren’tworking, rather than attributing most of the success to just the first or final touchpoint.",
      "Conversion rate → Account engagement score | Conversion rate is simple: How many people interacted with your marketing content, and what percentage then became a customer.",
      "But it lacks the nuance that could help you win more customers.",
      "AnAccount Engagement Scoretakes a look at account behavior and how closely an account’s behavior matches past, A score between one and 100 is assigned telling marketing and sales how engaged that account is, based on research, website visits, clicks, keywords researched, and videos played.",
      "The higher the score, the higher likelihood that the account is ready to buy, so it’s time to target them with more content or pick up the phone.",

      "What is sales intelligence? | The sales world is built on information. The ability to gather, analyze, and leverage information can make In the hyper-competitive market for B2B solutions, the difference between hitting your revenue targets and missing them often comes down to one thing: intelligence. Not just data — actionable, timely intelligence that gives your sales team the edge they need to win. | Who’s actively searching for solutions like yours — right now | Which decision-makers you need to engage at target accounts | What specific pain points are driving their search | When they’re most receptive to your message",
      "Sales intelligencetransforms the way you sell by revealing the exact information you need about prospects, when you need it:",
      "Beyond basic contact information, robust sales intelligence delivers the buying signals, company insights, and behavioral patterns that let your team focus on the right accounts at the right time with the right message. It eliminates guesswork and replaces it with precision.",
      "The most successful sales organizations don’t just collect data — they harness it.They convert raw information into strategic actions that directly impact revenue:",
      "With effective sales intelligence, your team stops shooting in the dark and starts executing with surgical precision. They spend less time researching and more time engaging in meaningful conversations that move deals forward.",
      "In the following sections, we’ll break down exactly how sales intelligence works, what components make it powerful, and how leading organizations are leveraging it to consistently outperform their competition.",
      "Firmographics | Firmographics is a category of data that reveals the crucial basic elements of an organization. When armed with a technology platform that empowers you to review firmographic information, you’ll get the bird’s-eye view of a business.",
      "Psychographics | Psychographics are your way of understanding how an account makes decisions based on what they believe is intellectually or emotionally important. If you want to build strong relationships as part of your sales strategy, an innate understanding of an account’s psychographic profile is key.",
      "Diving into the psychographics of an account will give you a fuller picture of what motivates them.",
      "Technographics | Technographics reveal the technology an organization uses. Whether it’s the CRM, MAP, SEP, or any other type of technology they use, this information helps you uncover the critical systems an organization relies on.",
      "You can use this information to identify accounts that would most benefit from your services. Or you can even use it to identify which organizations are using yourcompetitor’sproducts, and then target them with a replacement campaign.",
      "If your products or services integrate with other popular technologies and add value, technographics will be crucial to crafting your campaigns.",
      "Market updates | Macroeconomics will always have a huge impact on the buying landscape.",
      "The overall economy has a big impact on B2B spending, especially for new purchases. But in any economic environment, there will be companies",
      "It would be unrealistic to keep tabs on ‌market updates for all of your target accounts.

      "To market and sell effectively to B2B buyers, you need to be able to associate intent signals with an account and understand how many people within that account are researching, what the buying group cares about, and how close they are to a decision.",
      "Intent data helps you prioritize outreach to the prospects that are most likely to help you hit revenue targets. It also gives you the insights to craft personalized messaging that addresses the specific, current needs of buyers.",
      "Align sales and marketing | Sales and marketing have often clashed because it’s traditionally difficult to understand which specific activities are yielding results.",
      "Marketing can feel like sales isn’t following up on the leads they’re generating, while sales might feel like the leads they’re receiving are of low quality.",
      "With sales intelligence, both marketing and sales teams have access to the same deep insights about buyers. This naturally aligns them and removes guesswork about what messaging or campaigns might work best for any given account.",
      "Sales intelligence makes it easy for marketing to craft highly relevant campaigns that flow naturally with sales’ efforts to engage key buyers. Instead of worrying about attribution for a deal, the teams work in lockstep to drive revenue.",

      "Some ABM programs include 1:1 personalization, and others function with a 1:few or 1:many approach. Regardless, personalization can be done in ascalable waythat works for your business.",
      "You may have experienced an “ABM moment” yourself. If you’ve ever read a B2B email subject line or ad headline and thoughtI was just thinking that!, then you know what we’re talking about.",
      "But it takes thoughtfulness (and as you’ll see, some restraint) to achieve that level of resonance with buyers. And to get there, ABM practitioners must embrace certainpersonalization fundamentals that just plain work— and then level-up from there.",
      "Here’s some spin-free advice on how to kickstart, and then effectively evolve, your ABM approach.",
      "ABM personalization is rarely 1:1 | True, meticulously tuned, 1:1 ABM personalization and engagement should be reserved for extra-special use cases. (VIP accounts that can single-handedly vault your business to new levels are a good example.)",
      "Certainly, bespoke marketing is possible given today’s technology offerings. But personalization initiatives are often more effective when they’re realigned from a one-to-many mass marketing program to a one-to-few approach.",
      "Slow your roll with personalization | Why not take a deeply personalized 1:1 approach? For starters, too much personalization can be a turnoff.",
      "You want your sellers to help and educate buyers, and not creep them out with stalkerish references to their job roles (or even personal lives).",
      "It also boils down to bandwidth. The sheer effort it’d take to craft uniquely personalized messaging for all your accounts isn’t economically viable or sustainable, and also may not be a good return on your investment.",
      "The secret is scalability | The best ABM approaches blend personalization (interacting with audiences in ways that feel human and special) with orchestration (coordinating and mobilizing groups of data). This helps you create honed-in experiences for buyers, but at-scale for an expansive marketplace.",
      "All those emails your sales team individually writes with varying accuracy and effectiveness? They can still feel natural but be more controlled, turn-key, and rooted in data, while still providing value to the recipient. Trying to do things on a onesey-twosey basis just isn’t feasible, sopersonalize at scale.",
      "Personalize only what matters | Any good cook knows that adding too many ingredients ruins a flavor profile. Similarly, personalization that’s not kept in check can quickly erode a brand’s credibility.",
      "Resist the temptation to customize just because you can. Instead, ground your personalization in the stuff that matters most to your revenue team and your buyers.",
      "Start with segmentation | Before you tailor messages to your business buyer audience, it’s helpful to strategically segment them into groupings. (Often, it’s wise to segment your customers and rally your efforts based on Annual Contract Value.)",
      "Prioritizing where you see the most bang for the buck might sound too simplistic. But starting simple is what it’s about.",
      "What happens after segmentation? | From there, your main levers of personalization will likely include keywords, competitor keywords, buying stages, and value propositions.",
      "It occasionally makes sense to curate your messages by other business factors. For example, you might want to accommodate an extra-strength buyer readiness signal — perhaps the way extreme weather, an executive order, or a change in the tax code uniquely affects a prospect’s business.",
      "But making these personalization the norm rather than the exception can easily unnerve customers. (Remember, too much personalization is creepy.) It wastes time, too. Instead, pour your energy into aligning your channels so buyers have consistent, personalized-at-scale experiences wherever they may roam.",
      "Test it, prove it & grow it | We hope we’ve made the case for being prudent with your personalization efforts. Personalization is a shiny object in the RevOps toolkit, but resist the temptation to take it too far, too soon.",

      "Then methodically test, learn, and bring to scale. Figure out what works, what doesn’t, and pivot accordingly. Not everything is going to work right away, and that’s okay.",
      "As your approach becomes more proven, you can judiciously add other bells and whistles to your content. But remember: a little goes a long way.",

      "This kind of choreography is transformative for organizations … but it also warrants extra communication.",
      "Again, toe-dips into this pool are better than cannonball dives. Take time to consider what your key personas truly care about and what you can give them along their journeys, often independent of sales intervention.",
      "It’s also imperative to be methodical, and always consider the customer’s point of view. Make sure you’re delivering consistent messages across all channels.",
      "Produce content that addresses the needs of as many divisions of your revenue team as possible: the marketers responsible for the brand, the BDRs who need to close, the customer success reps nearest to accounts, and more.",
      "Analyze, iterate & win | Annually, or during times of significant organizational change like a big merger or reorganization, be sure to reexamine long-range business needs and keywords.",
      "Templates are great for long-term programs, but you might also want to launch one-off personalized campaigns to niche audiences based on your revenue goals or shortcomings.",
      "Quarterly, reassess and consider refreshing specific messages and tactics based on recent revenue performance — and upcoming needs.",
      "Just because everything seems to be working doesn’t mean you can’t tweak. You may in fact want to double-down on specific tactics and value props.",
      "Ultimately, you want to help and educate buyers, not spook them. It’s best to anchor your customization in high-value data.  And while personalization creates any number of new and neat tricks, be sure to take a measured team approach so you don’t drain resources on your way to dramatically improved buyer engagement and predictable revenue growth.",

      "In our recent report,What’s (Currently) Measured Isn’t What Matters: The State of B2B Marketing Metrics in 2025, nearly 80% of organizations report having an ABM program, but only 29% of ABM teams are measured solely through ABM-aligned metrics.",
      "This reveals a significant disconnect: Marketers are doing one thing (ABM) but measuring another (leads and MQLs), undermining ABM effectiveness and making it difficult to prove true ROI.",
      "This comprehensive framework will help you bridge that gap and evolve your account-based marketing measurement approach.",
      "Account-based metrics are specialized key performance indicators that measure marketing’s impact on specific target accounts rather than individual leads.Unlike traditional marketing metrics that emphasize volume and quantity, ABM metrics prioritize quality, engagement depth, and revenue impact from strategically selected accounts.",

      "How to measure account-based marketing | Measuring account-based marketing requires a shift from lead-based to account-centric measurement approaches. Key ABM metrics to track include:",
      "The 2025 report shows that nearly half of ABM adoptersstill measure success by MQLs, even from non-target accounts.This uncovers a fundamental misalignment between ABM strategy and measurement practice, where marketing qualified accounts from target accounts are tracked almost equally with marketing qualified leads from non-target accounts (49% vs. 44%). By treating strategically selected target accounts the same as random inbound leads, it’s difficult for ABM teams to assess whether account-based investments are generating better results than traditional efforts.",
      "Establishing internal benchmarks | Your internal benchmarks should reflect your specific industry, deal size, and sales cycle characteristics. Consider these factors when establishing your measurement framework:",
      "Finally, consider both sourced and influenced attribution approaches based on your use case and buying cycle length. With typically long B2B buying cycles, source-based attribution can be problematic because it credits a single “first touch” that may have occurred months before any serious buying activity began, ignoring the complex research and evaluation process that actually drives purchase decisions. Measuring influence or lift can offer advantages since it captures marketing’s impact across the entire buying journey, accounting for how campaigns affect conversion rates, deal velocity, and win rates throughout the extended evaluation.",
      "What are the three pillars of ABM metrics? | These three pillars of ABM success metrics provide a comprehensive framework for measuring account-based marketing effectiveness across the entire customer journey.",
      "The earliestand often most criticalstage of the buyer journey. This pillar focuses on measuring how effectively you reach and engage your target accounts before they enter formal sales processes.Given that 84% of buyers have already selected their preferred vendorbefore contacting sellers, the awareness and engagement stage is paramount for earning consideration from buying groups.",
      "Understanding awareness and engagement addresses a major challenge in modern B2B marketing:Most buyer research happens anonymously and across multiple touchpoints. The solution is to gather intent data that ties anonymous research activities to specific accounts and provides clues about which buyer personas are actively engaged. AI analysis of intent signals can then predict the buying stage of accounts.",
      "For instance, when more than one member of the same buying team is researching your brand or related solutions, that sends a signal that the team is serious about purchasing, enabling marketing teams to identify and prioritize accounts showing genuine purchase intent rather than casual browsing behavior.",
      "2. Pipeline progression metrics | This pillar measures how effectively engaged accounts convert into viable sales opportunities. Pipeline development metrics bridge the gap between marketing engagement and sales outcomes, providing visibility into how effectively marketing activities translate into qualified opportunities.",
      "Unlike traditional lead-based approaches that focus on individual qualification, pipeline development metrics examine account-level progression and buying group completeness. This perspective becomes crucial for organizations seeking to demonstrate marketing’s strategic value beyond lead generation, particularly when sales cycles are lengthy and involve complex stakeholder dynamics. The focus shifts from counting individual leads to understanding how entire accounts move through consideration stages, plus how marketing efforts influence the speed and quality of that progression.",
      "It’s not about generating leads; it’s about generating stage-by-stage pipeline value that translates into revenue.",
      "According to research fromThe Impact of ABM Metrics on Financial Performance, ABM-centric metrics are more strongly correlated with better financial performance than traditional measurements. This pillar captures not just immediate revenue attribution but also long-term account value and program efficiency.",
      "Our 2025 report revealed thatonly 13% of ABM programs report closed-won revenueto leadership.This is ahuge strategic gapthat can undermine investment in ABM efforts. Revenue impact metrics provide the business case for continued ABM investment while demonstrating marketing’s direct contribution to organizational growth objectives.",
      "Rather than simply tracking whether deals close, this pillar examines the quality and sustainability of revenue generated through ABM efforts, including expansion opportunities within accounts and the overall return on marketing investments. These ABM success metrics work together to provide complete visibility into program performance, enabling a focus on lifetime customer value that drives sustainable revenue growth.",
      "Traditional marketing metrics vs. account-based marketing metrics | The shift from traditional lead-based marketing to account-based marketing represents a major change in how B2B organizations measure success. This transition reflects the reality of modern B2B buying, where decisions are made by groups rather than individuals, and lengthy evaluation processes require sustained engagement strategies.",
      "A lot of common consumer marketing metrics are a poor fit for B2B. Sure, they tell you something about how and where someone engaged with a piece of content. But the devil is in the lack of details, as noted inthis 6sense guide. Traditional metrics emphasize volume and individual actions:",
      "For quick buying cycles involving a single decision-maker, they work great. For B2B, they fall short.",
      "Quality vs. quantity:Traditional metrics often reward high-volume activities, while ABM metrics emphasize engagement quality and depth within strategically selected accounts.",
      "Individual vs. group:Legacy approaches track individual lead behavior, whereas ABM metrics monitor buying group dynamics and collective account activities.",
      "Attribution complexity:Account-based teams rely on both sourced and influenced attribution, with 57% using combined approaches, recognizing the multi-touch nature of B2B buying journeys.",
      "The persistence of these legacy practices suggests that while account-based teams are adopting new marketing methods, measurement practices are more difficult to replace.",

This ignores the complex research and evaluation process that actually drives purchase decisions. Measuring influence or lift can offer advantages since it captures marketing’s impact across the entire buying journey, accounting for how campaigns affect conversion rates, deal velocity, and win rates throughout the extended evaluation.",
      "Why do only 13% of ABM programs report closed-won revenue to leadership? | This represents a huge strategic gap that can undermine investment in ABM efforts. Many organizations still rely on traditional metrics and haven’t developed the systems or processes to properly track and report revenue attribution from ABM programs. This makes it difficult to demonstrate ABM’s direct contribution to organizational growth objectives and secure continued investment.",
      "What is the biggest mistake organizations make with ABM measurement? | The biggest mistake is treating strategically selected target accounts the same as random inbound leads. Nearly half of ABM adopters still measure success by MQLs, even from non-target accounts. This makes it difficult for ABM teams to assess whether account-based investments are generating better results than traditional efforts, creating a fundamental misalignment between ABM strategy and measurement practice.",

      "What are ABM metrics? | Account-based metrics are specialized key performance indicators that measure marketing’s impact on specific target accounts rather than individual leads.

      "ABM benchmark metrics for 2025 | The 2025 report shows that nearly half of ABM adopters still measure success by MQLs , even from non-target accounts. This uncovers a fundamental misalignment between ABM strategy and measurement practice, where marketing qualified accounts from target accounts are tracked almost equally with marketing qualified leads from non-target accounts (49% vs. 44%). By treating strategically selected target accounts the same as random inbound leads, it’s difficult for ABM teams to assess whether account-based investments are generating better results than traditional efforts.",

    "p": [
      "How do you define lead generation? Well, it’s not just about finding potential customers.It’s about finding therightcustomersand knowing exactly how to guide them on a journey towards becomingloyalcustomers.",
      "Of course, that’s easier said than done! According to a 2021 survey from Ruler Analytics,37% of B2B marketersconsider generating high-quality leads their top challenge.",
      "If you’re struggling with the same challenge, this guide is for you. We’re going to:",
      "Quick Take: B2B lead generation should focus on targetingmultiple peoplewithinorganizations, not just individuals.",
      "Lead generation is the systematic process of identifying, engaging, and nurturing visitors who fit your buyer personas andideal customer profile (ICP).",
      "This process is especially critical for B2B companies, where complex decision-making processes and longer sales cycles require a sophisticated approach.",
      "B2B vs. B2C lead generation: understanding the difference | While B2B and B2C lead generation share the same core concept, their execution differs significantly.",
      "For B2C companies, lead generation strategies targetindividual consumers. The company must craft messaging and strategies that appeal to the personal preferences and needs of these individual buyers. It often involves a shortersales processand a focus on a broader audience.",
      "For B2B companies, lead generation means engaging withorganizations, each with its own structure, decision-making units, and unique pain points. B2B leads are typically acquired through relationships with key decision-makers, extensive research, and tailored strategies that cater to a nichetarget audience.",
      "Key components of a successful lead generation strategy | Quick Take: Know your buyer and their pain points. Then respect their time by delivering value in every interaction.",
      "Buyer personas and target audience identification | First, you must understand your audience. Start by creating detailed buyer personas representing your ideal customers. That means diving deep into their pain points, motivations, and behaviors.",
      "For instance, if you’re a B2B software provider, a buyer persona might be “IT Manager John,” who seeks efficient solutions to streamline operations and prioritize data security. He might also be responsible for managing a team of tech professionals, and prioritize tools that optimize workflow while assisting withregulatory compliance.",
      "Offer each persona a clear value proposition | To stand out in a sea of competitors, you need to articulate why prospects should choose your offering over others. Your value propositions should answer the lead’s question, “What’s in it for me?”",
      "Landing pages and lead magnets | Once you’ve captured your audience’s attention with tailored messaging, you need a place to direct them — a landing page. An effective landing page converts visitors into leads by encouraging them to take a specific action, such as signing up for a free trial, requesting a demo, or downloading a resource.",
      "Effective landing pages are clean, focused, and centered around a single call-to-action (CTA). They should also match the messaging that brought visitors there in the first place, providing a seamless experience.",
      "When using web forms to collect contact data, you can incentivize visitors to exchange their contact information for valuable content like ebooks, whitepapers, or webinars.",
      "Gating all of your valuable content can be self-defeating, though, sincemany visitors avoid filling out web forms. Make sure prospects who are early in their buying journey can do effective self-serve research on your site. Otherwise, they’ll go elsewhere.",
      "Lead nurturing workflows | Once you’ve captured leads, your goal is to guide and nurture them through the buyer’s journey, from initial awareness to the final decision-making stage. This process involves providing relevant, valuable content at each step to keep your leads engaged and informed.",
      "Imagine your buyer persona has just downloaded your ebook on CRM software. Now, it’s time to nurture this lead. You might start with a series of automated emails discussing the CRM’s top benefits, best practices, and success stories. As the lead progresses through these emails, they gain a clearer understanding of how your software can revolutionize their company’s operations.",
      "Effective lead nurturing workflowsare also personalized and well-timed. They adapt to each lead’s behavior and engagement level. If your lead clicks on an email link about data security, you can tailor later emails to focus more on this aspect of your software.",
      "B2B lead generation strategies | Quick Take: You need an omnichannel approach to reach and influence buyers. The tactics below reinforce one another.",
      "Now that we’ve established the core components of a successful lead generation strategy, let’s dive into some specialized B2B lead generation tactics that can supercharge your efforts.",
      "Content marketing for lead gen | In-depth, industry-specific content is a powerful tool. Think whitepapers, case studies, video tutorials, and informative blog posts tailored to your ideal buyer’s pain points and interests.",
      "For example, let’s say you offer cybersecurity services, and your ideal buyer is Alex, a Chief Information Security Officer at a financial institution. What type of content can you create?",
      "Regardless of the content format, the goal of this lead generation tactic is to leave your buyer persona thinking, “This company truly understands the unique challenges we face and can provide the solution we need.”",
      "For instance, if you’re a SaaS company offering different software solutions, you wouldn’t want to send the same email to a startup founder and a Chief Technology Officer of a large enterprise. They have distinct needs and interests.",
      "When emailing a list of prospects, your audiences should be carefully segmented so you can deliver relevant campaigns.",
      "Consider employing automation with6sense’s Conversational Email toolto streamline your email efforts. It can:",
      "Social media outreach strategies | Social media platforms are valuable B2B lead generation tools. However, it’s crucial to approach social media outreach with a clear strategy in mind.",
      "First, identify the social media channels where your target audience is most active. For B2B, platforms like LinkedIn and X (formerly Twitter) are often hotspots for professional networking and lead generation.",
      "Next, you’ll want to engage with decision-makers, join industry groups, and share content that resonates with your audience and positions you as a thought leader. For example, you might share insightful articles on industry trends, comment on relevant posts, and participate in group discussions to establish your expertise.",
      "Paid social advertising is another avenue to explore. LinkedIn in particular is a goldmine for this type of B2B lead generation. According to a recent report,nearly 85% of B2B teams use LinkedInduring the buying process. For a step-by-step guide on using LinkedIn to generate high-quality leads, check out these5 Recipes for Creating Effective, Perfectly Timed LinkedIn Ad Campaigns.",
      "Webinars and events for B2B leads | Webinars and events are also excellent tools for showcasing your expertise, interacting directly with your target audience, and collecting valuable B2B leads.",
      "Consider this scenario: You’re a marketing consultancy firm specializing in SEO services. You can attract marketing managers, business owners, and SEO enthusiasts by hosting a webinar titled “Mastering SEO Trends for 2024.”",
      "During the webinar, you can provide valuable information, share success stories, and offer actionable tips. Attendees who find your content helpful are more likely to engage with your brand and consider your services in the future.",
      "Industry conferences and trade shows also offer excellent opportunities for B2B lead generation. These events gather professionals and decision-makers in one place, providing you with a captive audience interested in your industry.",
      "To maximize the impact of webinars and events, consider offering incentives for attendees to share their contact information. For example, you can provide access to exclusive resources, downloadable materials, or special discounts in exchange for their details.",
      "If you’re using 6sense, you have even more options for lead generation from events.",
      "Cold outreach and personalized messaging | Cold outreach, combined with personalized messaging, is a B2B lead generation technique that can yield remarkable results when executed strategically. This approach involves reaching out to potential leads who may not be familiar with your brand or offerings.",
      "The key to successful cold outreach is personalization. Generic, one-size-fits-all messages are unlikely to grab the attention of busy professionals. Instead, you must craft tailored messages that address each recipient’s specific pain points, needs, and interests.",
      "Start by conducting thorough research on your prospects. Understand their roles, challenges, and objectives within their organizations. This information will be invaluable in customizing your outreach.",
      "For instance, if you offer HR software solutions, and your target is the HR manager of a mid-sized tech company, your message might begin by acknowledging the unique challenges HR managers face in tech environments. You can then highlight how your software streamlines HR processes and improves efficiency.",
      "Intent datais a huge advantage for this type of outreach, since it can let you know which leads are likely to be receptive, and it also give you insights into the topics they are likely to care about.",
      "Using automation for lead generation | Quick Take: Basic automations save time and ensure prospects receive valuable information. Automations triggered by AI can quickly respond to account behavior, keeping your messaging on point.",
      "Picture this: You’ve got a team of tireless virtual assistants working around the clock, ensuring your message lands right in the laps of your dream clients precisely when they’re most receptive. How? Automation.",
      "Here are some automation strategies that can streamline and optimize your lead generation efforts.",
      "Email marketing automation | Email marketing automation tools allow you to send targeted and personalized email campaigns to leads based on their behavior and preferences. By tracking actions such as email opens, link clicks, and content downloads, you can segment your email list and deliver relevant content.",
      "For example, suppose a lead has shown interest in a specific product or service. In that case, automation can trigger a series of follow-up emails that provide more in-depth information and nurture the lead further down the sales funnel.",
      "CRM (customer relationship management) software | A CRM system centralizes lead data and interactions, enabling your team to manage and track leads effectively. By recording all touchpoints with leads — including emails, calls, and meetings — you gain a holistic view of each lead’s journey.",
      "This information helps sales and marketing teams tailor their communication, identify opportunities for follow-up, and provide a more personalized experience, ultimately increasing the chances of conversions.",
      "Chatbots | Chatbots offer real-time engagement on your website, providing immediate responses to visitor inquiries. They can also collect basic lead information, such as names and email addresses, and initiate conversations.",
      "For instance, a chatbot can ask visitors if they’d like to subscribe to your newsletter or receive a downloadable resource, capturing leads.",
      "Lead scoringassigns numerical values to leads based on their engagement and behavior. This allows you to prioritize leads and focus your efforts on those likely to convert.",
      "For example, leads who have visited your pricing page, downloaded a product brochure, and interacted with your emails might receive a higher lead score. Automation can then trigger actions when leads reach specific score thresholds, such as notifying the sales team to reach out to high-scoring leads immediately.",
      "Analytics and reporting | Automation in analytics tools helps you track and measure the performance of your lead generation campaigns in real time. This data provides insights into which strategies are most effective, enabling you to continually make data-driven decisions and optimize your lead generation efforts.",
      "For example, you can automatically generate reports that show the ROI of specific marketing campaigns, helping you allocate resources more efficiently.",
      "6sense makes marketing more powerful by enablingAI for lead generation, allowing marketing and sales teams tocreate audience segmentsbased on what buyers are interested in and what stage of the buying process they are in.",
      "Accounts often take several months to make B2B purchases. During this period, they may be exploring a variety of topics. 6sense can detect buying indicators that tell you what accounts are currently looking into. This data can help you create personalized campaigns tailored to the precise needs of each account in real-time.",
      "This can lead to increased lead generation, improved conversion rates, and higher ROI.",
      "Outbound lead generation techniques | Quick Take: Respect people’s time. If you’re going to initiate contact, have a plan. Do research. Understand the value you can offer, and deliver that promise quickly.",
      "While inbound strategies (e.g., content marketing) work to attract leads to you, outbound lead generation takes the initiative with proactive outreach. If you master the following techniques, you’ll be in the driver’s seat, accelerating your lead acquisition and expanding your business’s reach.",
      "Cold calling and cold emailing | Your ideal customer may not always come knocking on your door, but that doesn’t mean you can’t reach out and introduce yourself. Cold calling and cold emailing are classic outbound lead generation techniques that, when done right, can yield excellent results.",
      "When cold calling, preparation is key. Before picking up the phone, research your prospect and their company.6sense’s guide to B2B prospectingwill help you learn how to understand their pain points, industry challenges, and how your product or service can provide solutions. Craft a concise and compelling script that highlights the value you can offer.",

      "Okay, ugly truth time: There is a huge gulf between ABM adoption and actual ABM success in B2B marketing. The reason: A lot of ABM strategy is hampered by inadequate buy-in and half-measures. | 40% reductions in campaign execution time, | 37% increases in engagement rates, and | 14% improvementsin pipeline conversion.",
      "While8 out of 10 B2B organizations report having an ABM program,only 20% reporttheir programs are fully embedded in business operations. And it creates a big opportunity gap. Companies willing to move beyond basic account targeting — toward sophisticated, AI-powered ABM strategies — enjoy a massive competitive advantage.",
      "The numbers tell a compelling story.91% ofcompanies implementing comprehensive ABM strategies see average deal size increase, and97% reporthigher ROI than traditional marketing.",
      "The convergence of artificial intelligence and intent data has fundamentally transformed what’s possible with ABM strategy.Companies using AI-powered ABMsee",
      "Intent data, now used by91% of B2B marketers, enables unprecedented precision in account targeting and timing, with companies likeSiemensachieving remarkable transformations from 1% to 90% sales acceptance of marketing-qualified leads.",
      "This guide reveals how modern ABM strategies leverage these technological advances to create sustainable competitive advantages.",
      "ABM strategy goes far beyond tactical execution like personalized emails, targeted ads, and account-specific landing pages.True ABM strategy encompasses a fundamental look at your entire go-to-market approach.",
      "The distinction matters. Tactics are important, but strategic ABM addresses deeper questions about market positioning, resource allocation, technology integration, and long-term competitive advantage. It’s the difference between running targeted campaigns and transforming how your organization approaches high-value customer acquisition.",
      "Today’s most successful ABM programs integrate artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, and real-time intent data to create “always-on” account engagement. Rather than launching discrete campaigns, these organizations maintain continuous, personalized interactions with target accounts based on buying signals, competitive dynamics, and engagement depth.",
      "The most effective strategies incorporateintent signalsandpredictive analyticsto identify accounts that are ready to buy and have the highest revenue potential. This evolution matters because43% of organizations strugglewith target selection. Sophisticated account intelligence is a crucial competitive advantage.",
      "If you’re not strategically engaging the entire buying team, you’re missing an opportunity to win more opportunities and close more deals. Enterprise purchasing decisions now involve anaverage of 14stakeholders, each with different priorities, information consumption preferences, and influence levels. Across companies of all sizes, the average buying group consists of 11 people.",
      "Technology and automation framework | The most successful ABM strategies integrate multiple technology platforms — CRM,  marketing automation, intent data, and AI-powered orchestration tools — to capture customer and share data that enables smooth customer journeys and a smart use of team resources. This integration becomes crucial as marketing teams manage increasingly complex multi-channel campaigns across dozens or hundreds of target accounts.",
      "Performance measurement and optimization | Strategic ABM measures account-level engagement progression, pipeline velocity improvements, and long-term customer value creation. These metrics inform strategic decisions about resource allocation, technology investment, and market focus.",
      "The financial impact of strategic ABM becomes clear when examining performance differences between organizations with mature programs versus those still operating at campaign level. Companies with mature strategies report234% faster pipeline progressionfor ad-influenced accounts and65%of companies report improvements in customer lifetime value.",
      "Competitive advantage through AI and intent data | The integration of artificial intelligence into ABM strategies enables fundamentally different strategic approaches. AI-powered platforms can analyze billions of signals to identify research being done by specific accounts, predict account behavior, understand buying stages, and personalize interactions at scale previously impossible with manual processes.",
      "Intent dataprovides the foundation for proactive ABM strategies. Instead of waiting for accounts to express interest through form fills or direct inquiries, organizations can identify accounts showing early-stage buying signals and engage before competitors recognize the opportunity.This first-mover advantage becomes crucial in competitive markets where timing often determines win/loss outcomes.",
      "The technology evolution also addresses scalability challenges that previously limited ABM to small account sets. Modern platforms enable personalized engagement across hundreds or thousands of accounts while maintaining the relevance and timing that drive ABM effectiveness. This scalability allows organizations to reach more of their addressable market while preserving the high-touch engagement that accounts demand.",
      "Example:BioCatchused AI-powered account targeting to achieve a 63% increase in accounts reaching active engagement stage. The results came not from strategic changes in account identification, engagement timing, and multi-channel orchestration made possibly by AI that gathered and analyzed intent data, then fed those insights into campaign execution.",
      "The modern ABM strategy framework | Building effective ABM strategy requires moving beyond ad hoc campaign approaches toward systematic frameworks that address account selection, technology integration, and performance optimization. The most successful organizations follow structured approaches that balance strategic planning with execution flexibility, allowing them to maintain consistency while adapting to market changes and account-specific opportunities.",
      "The framework outlined below reflects best practices from organizations achieving the highest ABM performance levels.Rather than prescriptive step-by-step processes, it provides strategic guidance that can be adapted to different industries, company sizes, and technology environments while maintaining the core elements that drive ABM success.",
      "Account identification and prioritizationforms the cornerstone of strategic ABM success. Unlike traditional approaches that rely primarily on basic firmographic criteria — company size, industry, geography — modern account selection integrates predictive analytics, intent signals, and competitive intelligence to identify accounts with the highest revenue potential and optimal engagement timing.",
      "Advanced account selection incorporates multiple data sources and analytical approaches. Predictive analytics identify accounts showing characteristics similar to your best customers, while intent data reveals accounts actively researching solutions in your category. Competitive intelligence helps prioritize accounts where you have positioning advantages or existing relationship foundations.",
      "Successful technology strategies prioritize integration over individual platform capabilities. The goal involves creating seamless data flow between account identification, engagement orchestration, and performance measurement systems. Organizations achieving the best results use unified platforms that eliminate manual data transfer and enable real-time optimization based on account engagement signals.",
      "Modern ABM platforms integrate artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate routine decisions while providing human teams with actionable insights. This automation becomes crucial as campaigns scale beyond manual management capabilities. Intelligent workflows can automatically adjust messaging, timing, and channel selection based on account behavior while maintaining the personalization that drives ABM effectiveness.",
      "Multi-channel orchestration | Effective orchestration requires sophisticated coordination across email, social media, content marketing, advertising, and sales outreach activities.",
      "Intelligent workflow automationaddresses this complexity by enabling dynamic campaign adjustments based on real-time account signals. Rather than using static audience lists that are never updated frequently enough, these systems shift accounts and known contacts into specific campaign sequences based on their behavior — which keeps messaging on-point and delivers a cohesive buyer journey across touchpoints.",
      "Sales and marketing alignment | Alignment extends beyond shared metrics to include integrated processes, unified technology platforms, and collaborative account planning.",
      "AfterJAGGAERintegrated 6sense with their existing technology stack and establishing unified workflows between sales and marketing teams, they achieved $77,459 in cost savings during the first two months while engaging 147 unique accounts and moving 129 accounts to sales development representative sequences.",
      "AI enables hyper-personalization capabilities that were previously impossible at enterprise scale, but strategiccontent planning must address diverse stakeholder needs, varying industry requirements, and different stages of the buying journey.",
      "Account-specific content goes beyond inserting company names into email templates. Strategic personalization addresses specific business challenges, regulatory requirements, competitive positioning, and integration considerations relevant to each target account. This depth of customization requires significant content investment but generates proportionally higher engagement and conversion rates.",
      "Campaign execution | Modern platforms can manage complex, multi-touch sequences across multiple channels while adapting to real-time conditions .",
      "FireMonachieved 34% click-through rates, 50% increases in buyer engagement behavior, and 100% daily 6sense login rates among sellers by implementing comprehensive multi-channel campaigns powered by intelligent workflows. These results came from strategic technology integration rather than tactical campaign improvements.",
      "Real-time optimization capabilities distinguish strategic ABM from campaign-based approaches. Rather than analyzing performance after campaign completion, advanced systems provide continuous feedback that enables immediate adjustments to messaging, timing, and channel selection. This responsiveness becomes crucial for maintaining engagement throughout extended enterprise sales cycles.",
      "Performance monitoring | While traditional marketing measures impressions, clicks, and conversion rates, strategic ABM focuses on account-level engagement progression, pipeline velocity improvements, and long-term customer value creation.",
      "The most successful programs track account penetration (engagement across multiple stakeholders), relationship depth (frequency and quality of interactions), and competitive positioning (comparative engagement versus competitors). These metrics inform strategic decisions about resource allocation, technology investment, and market focus rather than simple campaign optimization.",
      "Technology integration: The AI advantage | Many organizations select point solutions for specific functions without considering workflow integration, data synchronization, or scalability requirements that determine long-term success.",
      "The legacy technology challenge | Modern ABM technology stacks typically include 8-12 core tools requiring careful integration planning. The proliferation of point solutions creates complexity without delivering proportional value.AI-powered ABM capabilities",
      "Intent data and predictive analytics | Intent data continues evolving. Early implementations focused on keyword-based signals, but modern platforms analyze behavioral patterns, content consumption sequences, and competitive research activities to provide nuanced insights into account readiness and priority topics. This evolution enables more precise engagement strategies that address specific account interests rather than generic industry messaging.",
      "Predictive analytics complement intent data by identifying accounts showing characteristics similar to successful customers before they demonstrate obvious buying signals. These capabilities enable proactive engagement that positions organizations as thought leaders rather than reactive vendors responding to explicit requests for information.",
      "The technology integration extends beyond marketing activities to include sales enablement, customer success, and account management functions. This comprehensive approach ensures consistent account experiences throughout the entire customer lifecycle rather than limiting ABM to lead generation activities.",
      "Ongoing learning to improve performance | Organizations with mature AI implementations achieve 3x increases in sales-qualified leads, while machine learning models continuously improve targeting precision based on performance data and market feedback.",
      "Continuous learning capabilities distinguish AI-powered ABM from static campaign approaches. These systems analyze engagement patterns, conversion outcomes, and competitive dynamics to refine account selection, messaging optimization, and timing recommendations. The result involves constantly improving performance without requiring manual analysis and adjustment.",
      "CRM synchronization and data flow | Successful integration ensures account engagement data flows seamlessly between marketing automation, sales engagement, and customer relationship management systems without requiring duplicate data entry or manual reporting. Using a CDP to connect data across the tech stack creates a single source of truth that can be regularly updated and keep tools synced.",
      "Advanced integration approaches create unified account records that combine intent signals, engagement history, sales activities, and relationship mapping. This comprehensive view enables sophisticated account planning that addresses multiple stakeholders, competitive dynamics, and relationship development opportunities.",
      "Marketing automation enhancement | Marketing automation becomes more powerful when integrated with ABM platforms. This combination enables sophisticated nurture strategies that respond to account-specific signals rather than generic demographic triggers.",
      "Measuring ABM strategy success | Strategic ABM measurement requires fundamentally different approaches than traditional marketing metrics. While campaign-based marketing might track impressions, clicks, and lead conversion rates, strategic ABM focuses on account-level engagement progression, relationship development, and long-term business impact metrics that reflect the multi-stakeholder, extended-cycle nature of enterprise B2B sales.",
      "The measurement evolution reflects broader changes in B2B buying behavior and sales cycle complexity. Traditional funnel metrics assume linear progression from awareness to consideration to purchase, but enterprise ABM involves multiple stakeholders, non-linear evaluation processes, and relationship-building activities that standard metrics cannot capture effectively.",
      "Primary metricsfor strategic ABM focus on business outcomes rather than marketing activities. Account engagement scores combine multiple interaction types, stakeholder levels, and engagement frequency to provide comprehensive views of account relationship strength and progression.",
      "Pipeline influence and revenue attribution require sophisticated tracking that connects marketing activities to sales outcomes across extended time periods. This attribution becomes complex because strategic ABM involves multiple touchpoints, diverse content types, and relationship-building activities that may not directly correlate with immediate sales activities.",
      "Common challenges and solutions | Strategic ABM implementation involves complex organizational, technological, and process challenges. Understanding these common obstacles and proven solutions helps organizations avoid predictable pitfalls while building sustainable ABM capabilities.",
      "Data reliability challenges | Poor account identification undermines personalization efforts, misdirects resource allocation, and creates measurement problems that make optimization impossible. These data problems often stem from fragmented systems, incomplete integration, and lack of data governance processes.",
      "The data quality issues extend beyond simple accuracy to include timeliness, completeness, and relevance for strategic decision-making. Account information that’s six months old may miss organizational changes, technology adoptions, or competitive developments that significantly impact engagement strategies and messaging relevance.",
      "Successful organizations address data challenges throughsystematic data auditing, multiple source validation, and continuous updating processes. Rather than relying on single data sources, they integrate multiple intelligence platforms and establish regular data quality reviews that maintain accuracy over time.",
      "Measurement complexity | Traditional marketing measurement approaches don’t translate effectively to account-based strategies that involve multiple stakeholders, extended time periods, and relationship-building activities that may not correlate directly with immediate sales outcomes.",
      "The attribution challenges become particularly complex because strategic ABM influences multiple stakeholders across extended buying cycles. Connecting specific marketing activities to ultimate sales outcomes requires sophisticated tracking systems and analytical approaches that many organizations lack experience implementing.",
      "Advanced measurement solutions require technology integration, process standardization, and analytical capabilities that extend beyond traditional marketing requirements. Organizations achieving measurement success invest in unified platforms, cross-functional analytics teams, and executive education about ABM measurement complexities.",
      "Technology and integration challenges | Platform proliferation creates operational complexity without delivering proportional value improvements. Many organizations accumulate multiple point solutions for specific functions without considering integration requirements, workflow efficiency, or long-term scalability needs.",
      "Data synchronization issues between marketing automation, CRM, and ABM platforms create accuracy problems that undermine strategic decision-making. When different systems contain conflicting account information or engagement data, teams make decisions based on incomplete or inaccurate information that reduces ABM effectiveness.",
      "Training and adoption requirements for complex technology stacks often exceed organizational capabilities, leading to low utilization rates and missed functionality. Without comprehensive training programs and ongoing support, sophisticated platforms become expensive tools that teams avoid rather than strategic assets that drive performance improvements.",
      "Phased implementation approaches | Rather than attempting comprehensive implementation immediately, successful organizations begin with pilot programs that demonstrate value and build internal expertise before scaling to larger account sets.",
      "The crawl-walk-run methodology provides proven framework for sustainable ABM development. Organizations begin with basic account identification and targeted content, progress through personalized engagement and measurement implementation, and ultimately achieve advanced automation and optimization capabilities.",
      "Change management best practices | Strategic ABM requires changes in team structures, process workflows, and success metrics that can create internal resistance without proper change management approaches.",
      "Executive sponsorship becomes crucial for overcoming organizational inertia and resource allocation challenges. ABM initiatives often require cross-functional cooperation and process changes that need executive support to implement successfully.",
      "Future of ABM strategy | The ABM landscape will experience fundamental transformation through 2027, driven by advancing AI capabilities, evolving buyer expectations, and economic pressures that demand greater efficiency and measurable results. Organizations building ABM strategies today must anticipate these changes to ensure their investments remain competitive and their capabilities scale with market evolution.",
      "Multi-agent AI systems | These systems will manage complex, multi-channel engagement strategies while adapting to real-time account behavior and competitive dynamics without manual intervention.",
      "The multi-agent approach addresses scalability limitations that currently constrain ABM to relatively small account sets. By automating routine decision-making and optimization activities, these systems will enable personalized engagement across thousands of accounts while maintaining the relevance and timing that drive ABM effectiveness.",
      "Real-time multimodal AI will integrate data from diverse sources — sensors, social signals, behavioral patterns, and competitive intelligence — to create comprehensive account intelligence that exceeds human analytical capabilities. This integration will enable sophisticated engagement strategies based on subtle signals and pattern recognition that manual processes cannot identify.",
      "Intent-based orchestration | These systems will recognize engagement patterns, competitive activities, and buying stage progression to optimize messaging, timing, and channel selection continuously.",
      "The orchestration sophistication will extend beyond marketing activities to include sales enablement, customer success, and account management coordination. This comprehensive approach will ensure consistent account experiences throughout the entire customer lifecycle rather than limiting automation to lead generation activities.",
      "Predictive pipeline acceleration will forecast deal closure probability based on engagement patterns, competitive positioning, and historical performance data. These forecasts will inform strategic decisions about resource allocation, territory planning, and investment priorities with accuracy levels that support confident business planning.",
      "Full-funnel lifecycle management | This ABM focus reflects the reality that customer lifetime value optimization requires coordinated strategies throughout the entire relationship rather than ending at initial purchase.",
      "The lifecycle approach integrates marketing automation, sales enablement, and customer success activities into unified strategies that maximize account value over time. This integration requires organizational changes, integrated technology platforms, and measurement approaches that track long-term relationship development rather than transaction-focused metrics.",
      "Account expansion strategies will become increasingly sophisticated, using AI to identify upsell and cross-sell opportunities based on usage patterns, organizational changes, and competitive developments. These capabilities will enable proactive account management that increases customer lifetime value while strengthening competitive positioning.",
      "Technology investment planning | Organizations should focus on platforms that provide strong integration APIs, scalable architecture, and regular capability updates rather than static feature lists.",
      "The platform selection criteria will shift toward AI-native solutions that incorporate machine learning throughout their functionality rather than traditional platforms with AI features added as supplements. This architectural difference will determine long-term competitive capabilities as AI integration becomes more sophisticated.",
      "Skill development requirements | Marketing teams will need capabilities in data analysis, strategy development, and technology orchestration rather than manual campaign management.",
      "The organizational structure evolution will favor cross-functional teams that combine marketing, sales, and customer success expertise with technology and analytical capabilities. These integrated teams will manage account relationships more effectively than traditional functional silos.",
      "Investment in continuous learning and adaptation capabilities will become crucial as AI reshapes business and behavior. Organizations that develop strong learning cultures and change management capabilities will adapt more successfully.",
      "Building your ABM strategy | Organizations beginning ABM strategic development should prioritize foundation building over rapid scaling. The crawl-walk-run methodology provides proven framework for sustainable capability development that builds internal expertise while demonstrating measurable value to secure ongoing investment and organizational support.",
      "This phase establishes measurement baselines, identifies process gaps, and builds team capabilities before scaling to larger initiatives.",
      "This phase requires technology integration, organizational process development, and measurement system implementation that support sustainable scaling.",
      "Organizations maintaining commitment through this development period achieve sustainable competitive advantages that compound over time, while those expecting immediate returns often abandon strategic approaches before realizing their potential value.",
      "Strategic ABM represents more than marketing technique evolution — it embodies fundamental changes in how B2B organizations approach high-value customer acquisition, relationship development, and competitive positioning. Companies mastering these strategic elements will build sustainable advantages in increasingly complex and competitive markets, while those treating ABM as tactical campaign enhancement will miss the transformative potential that defines modern B2B marketing success.",
      "The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that strategic ABM delivers transformative business results when implemented with appropriate technology, organizational alignment, and measurement sophistication.",
      "Conclusion | The transformation from traditional B2B marketing to strategic ABM represents a fundamental shift in how organizations build relationships with their most valuable prospects and customers.",
      "The evidence is compelling: companies implementing comprehensive ABM strategies see up to 208% revenueincreasesand 97% report higher ROI than traditional approaches.",
      "But these resultsdon’tcome from simply adopting new tools or running targeted campaigns.",
      "Success in strategic ABM requires three critical foundations working in harmony.",
      "Technology integrationmust go beyond point solutions to create unified platforms that enable intelligent automation while keeping the personalization that drives engagement. The 94% of professionals who prefer integrated solutions over disparate tools understand this reality from hard experience.",
      "Organizational alignmentbetween sales and marketing teams determines whether sophisticated technology investments translate into business impact or remain expensive underutilized resources.",
      "Measurement sophisticationthat tracks account-level progression and relationship depth rather than campaign metrics provides the insights needed for continuous optimization and strategic decision-making.",
      "The organizations thriving in this new landscape share a common characteristic: they view ABM as a strategic business capability rather than a marketing tactic. They invest in change management, executive sponsorship, and cross-functional processes that enable sustained competitive advantage.",
      "They understand that the crawl-walk-run implementation approach builds internal expertise and demonstrates value before scaling to enterprise-wide initiatives.",
      "Looking ahead, the convergence of AI, intent data, and predictive analytics will only accelerate the advantages available to organizations with mature ABM strategies. Multi-agent AI systems and real-time optimization capabilities will enable personalized engagement at unprecedented scale.",
      "The organizations that combine advanced capabilities with strategic thinking, organizational alignment, and measurement sophistication will build sustainable competitive moats in increasingly complex B2B markets.",

      "About the Episode: | In this episode, Kerry draws a powerful parallel between an infamous World War II holdout and the outdated war many B2B marketers are still fighting today: the battle to improve MQL production and conversion. | The Hiroo Onoda Analogy: What a decades-late WWII surrender can teach us about marketing inertia and cognitive dissonance. | The MQL Obsession: Why many B2B marketers are still committed to a lead gen strategy that no longer delivers value. | Evidence Against MQL Effectiveness: Real data from buyer experience studies showing form fills and early engagement are rare. | Buyer-Controlled Journeys: How buyers dictate the terms and timing of engagement, regardless of seller outreach. | Shortlist Dynamics: Understanding how buyers decide which vendors make the shortlist well before sales ever gets involved. | Buying Group Enablement: The importance of reaching not just primary buyers, but influential roles like finance and procurement. | AI & Automation for Relevance: How AI-driven orchestration can scale personalized engagement based on in-market signals. | Letting Go of the Form-Fill Fallacy: Why valuable content should be accessible without gating and how to reframe marketing success.",
      "Just as Japanese officer Hiroo Onoda remained in the jungle decades after WWII had ended, many marketers remain entrenched in the MQL mindset — committed to a cause that no longer serves the modern buyer, sales teams, or even marketing itself.",
      "Kerry uses historical context, buyer behavior data, and real-world survey findings to dismantle the myth that we can dictate buyer timing or manufacture meaningful engagement through gated content. Instead, he advocates a buyer-centric, signal-based strategy that aligns with how B2B buying actually happens.",

      "The 70/30 split: the new paradigm | 6sense research reveals a crucial insight: B2B buyers spend approximately 70% of their journey researching independently before engaging with vendors. This period is where preferences and shortlists emerge – and where the Signalverse™ is essential.",
      "“Buyers don’t talk to sellers until 70 percent of the way through the journey on average, and when they do, they have already picked a favorite and rarely change from that favorite.”",

      "Buying group dynamics | Globally, B2B purchases typically involve nine to 12 stakeholders, collaborating to and select solutions.",
      "Extended decision process | The average B2B buying journey spans 11.5 moths, with regional variations – 10.2 months in EMEA, 11.2 months in North America, and 13.2 months in APAC. This underscores the importance of sustained engagement.",

Our research shows that, on average, only 2.7% of MQLs convert into closed-won deals. That means 97% of the effort spent generating and nurturing MQLs results in little to no revenue impact.",
      "Many leaders we interviewed echoed this frustration. When MQLs don’t lead to real opportunities, they stop being a reliable metric for success. Instead, businesses need a model that reflects true buying intent across the entire account, not just an individual lead.",
      "The need for a holistic approach | By focusing solely on MQLs, you miss out on the rich tapestry of signals that buyers send throughout their journey. You also fail to account for the complexity of modern B2B buying, where multiple stakeholders influence the decision-making process.",

    "p": [
      "Executive summary | Your biggest revenue growth opportunity isn’t finding more leads — it’s engaging the 9-12 stakeholders your current approach is ignoring. | One MQL—  Someone hits your scoring threshold with a legitimate buyer persona role | MQL + Pre-MQL—  One qualified lead plus one person who’s engaged but hasn’t hit the threshold yet | Four Pre-MQLs—  Four people from the same organization engaging with your content, none hitting your MQL threshold",
      "While your marketing team hunts for individual MQLs, buying groups of 10+ people are researching solutions, forming preferences, and building consensus around vendors that aren’t you.",
      "By the time someone fills out your form,70% of their buying journey is complete and 84% of buyers have already chosen their preferred vendor.",
      "The companies consistently winning more deals haveshifted from lead-centric to account-centric strategies. They detect buying group activity early, coordinate engagement across multiple stakeholders, and measure success at the account level rather than the contact level.",
      "This transformation delivers measurable results: pipeline increases, conversion improvements, and faster sales cycles. The question isn’t whether to make this shift — it’s how quickly you can implement it before your competitors do.",
      "The death of the MQL | If you’re still measuring marketing success by MQL volume, you’re missing 80% of actual pipeline signals.",
      "B2B purchasing is fundamentally a team sport, yet most marketing and sales processes still operate as if deals are made by individuals. This disconnect costs companies qualified opportunities every single day.",
      "The myth of the single decision maker | The “one contact = one deal” mentality isn’t just outdated — it’s actively harmful. While you’re nurturing that single MQL through your funnel, nine other people are researching solutions, forming opinions, and building consensus around a vendor that isn’t you.",
      "Kerry Cunningham, former SiriusDecisions and Forrester analyst and current head of thought leadership at 6sense, has spent years studying how B2B buyers actually behave.His team’s researchreveals the starkreality of modern buying groups.",
      "Buying groups now average 10.6 people in North America, 9.8 in EMEA, and 12.8 in APAC. These aren’t casual observers — these are active participants in the evaluation and decision–[ME4]making process. By the time a single individual fills out a form on your website, the buying group has already completed 70% of its buying journey, established solution parameters, created a shortlist of potential vendors, and picked a favorite.",
      "Every day you focus on individual MQLs, you’re missing signals from 80% of the actual buying team.When someone from ABC Company fills out your form, there are likely 9-12 other people from that same organization already researching solutions. Some are on your website anonymously. Others are reading analyst reports. Still others are asking their networks for recommendations.",
      "Traditional lead scoring treats these additional signals as noise. Account-based thinking recognizes them as gold.",
      "If you’re optimizing for individual conversion and your competitor is optimizing for buying group engagement, who has the advantage when it comes time to make a shortlist?",
      "Zendeskfaced this reality head-on as they moved upmarket to target enterprise accounts.Brian Cabreros, their former Director of Marketing Operations, explains: “Figuring out who the buying teams are was very helpful — using 6sense to look at the keywords and engaged personas.”",
      "The results were immediate and measurable. Zendesk saw an 8% to 10% average increase in opportunity creation after implementing their buying team-focused approach.",
      "The shift wasn’t just about volume — it was about quality. Using6sense’s6AI™ engine, which processes over 1 trillion signals daily to analyze intent patterns and buying group behavior, the team could identify accounts in Decision or Purchase stages. The team decided to only pass along leads 6sense identified as high intent, meaning they were in either the Decision or Purchase stages of the buying journey. While this reduced the number of records BDRs would work, it dramatically increased their quality.",
      "When you understand that enterprises make decisions as groups, not individuals, everything changes: your targeting, your messaging, your measurement, and your results.",
      "By the time a prospect fills out a form,70% of their buying journey is complete. Companies that detect intent early and begin multithreading immediately have exponentially better odds of making the shortlist.",
      "The 70% problem | 6sense Research’s analysis of 2,500 buyer surveys reveals a timing problem that should fundamentally change how you think about demand generation. The vast majority of buyer research happens in the shadows, long before they’re ready to talk to vendors.",
      "Buyers spend only 17% their total buying time with sales reps, and only 5-6% with any single vendor.The other 83% is spent researching independently, building internal consensus, and forming preferences based on information they find on their own.",
      "This means that by the point of first contact — whether that’s a form fill, a demo request, or an inbound call — most of the critical decision-making has already happened. Preferences have been formed. Shortlists have been created. Your window for influence is closing fast.",
      "The point of first contact advantage | Here’s the statistic that should change how you think about lead generation: buyers contact their preferred vendor first 84% of the time in North America, with similar patterns globally.",
      "The companies that get contacted first aren’t necessarily better at closing deals. They’re better at being discovered and building preference during the anonymous research phase.",
      "Why MQLs arrive too late | Marketing Qualified Leads represent the moment when anonymous research transitions to identified engagement. But if 70% of the journey is already complete, MQLs are lagging indicators of buying intent, not leading indicators.",
      "Traditional MQL-based qualification is like trying to board a train that’s already left the station.",
      "The fundamental timing problem: MQL thresholds are designed to identify people ready to talk to sales, but buying group formation and vendor evaluation happen long before anyone is ready for that conversation.",
      "The ‘bad lead’ problem | People do fill out forms earlier in the journey when you put valuable content behind gates. Then they ghost you. Because they aren’t ready to talk yet. Sales teams often chalk these up as bad leads. But are they “bad” or just “too early in their research to want to talk”?",
      "One lead equals one signal. By itself, that signal may not indicate account readiness.",
      "The multithreading imperative | While your competitors wait for individual leads to respond and mature, smart companies are building relationships with entire buying groups during the anonymous research phase.",
      "When multiple stakeholders from the same organization encounter your content, your brand, and your point of view during independent research, you build mind share across the entire decision-making team.",
      "The companies that can identify and influence buying groups early will consistently outperform those stuck in lead-by-lead thinking.",
      "As you develop more content tailored to individual personas, you may encounter a catch-22: More people consuming your content because it’s valuable, even if they’re not in a buying process. But when multiple people from the same organization are researching similar topics, that’s not just about your content quality — that’s about buying intent.",
      "‘Hot or not’ revenue moment quiz | Test your ability to spot true buying signals vs. lead-scoring noise",
      "Can you identify the strongest revenue moment? Choose from these three scenarios:",
      "Which account do you think your sales team wants to know about the most?",
      "Answer: It’s always #3. Multiple people from the same organization engaging with your content is the strongest signal of active buying behavior, regardless of individual lead scores.",
      "As Kerry Cunningham explains: “If four people are doing the same thing, that is probably not a coincidence.”",
      "Sandler Trainingfaced the classic B2B challenge: individual contacts weren’t converting into pipeline at the rates they needed.Emily Davidson, Director of Enterprise Marketing, describes their realization: “We were previously going after individuals. However, we now know from market research, that these larger companies are no longer making single- person decisions. It’s a group decision by a buying team.”",
      "The transformation wasn’t just philosophical — it was operational. Sandler shifted their entire approach from individual nurturing to group engagement.",
      "The impact was dramatic: a 30% increase in marketing-influenced pipeline in just six months and a 60% increase in accounts reaching marketing-qualified account (MQA) status within the first month.",
      "When you align your approach with how buyers actually behave, results follow.",
      "The technology trap: How your current tools sabotage buying group success | Most marketing automation platforms and CRMs were built for individual leads, not buying groups. While you’re optimizing for individual conversions, your competitors using next- generation platforms are engaging entire buying committees — and winning deals you never knew you were competing for.",
      "BeforeFullStoryimplemented 6sense, their marketing team was trapped in what their VP of Growth Marketing calls a “spray-and-pray” approach. Despite having talented people and solid content, they couldn’t see buying group formation or coordinate engagement across multiple stakeholders. Individual leads came and went, but pipeline remained unpredictable.",
      "After integrating 6sense with their existing CRM and marketing automation platforms, FullStory saw immediate transformation: a 48% increase in Average Contract Value for in-market accounts, 27% revenue increase for net-new opportunities in just one quarter, and 36% increase in marketing-influenced qualified pipeline.",
      "The difference wasn’t better content or more leads — it was finally having technology that could detect and engage entire buying groups instead of individual contacts.",
      "Built for a different era | Marketing automation emerged in the early 2000s when B2B buying was simpler. The technology was designed around individual lead scoring, linear funnels, and one-to-one relationships — assumptions that create systematic disadvantages for companies still using these platforms today.",
      "While your team tracks individual email opens and form submissions, companies using account-based intelligence are monitoring coordinated research behavior across multiple stakeholders. When you see one lead, they see buying group formation. When you react to form fills, they proactively engage anonymous researchers.",
      "Traditional marketing automation platforms excel at tracking individual behavior but fundamentally cannot track coordinated group behavior, anonymous research patterns, and cross-stakeholder influence — the signals that actually predict modern B2B purchases.",
      "The duplicate lead problem | Here’s a scenario that costs companies millions every year while their competitors capture the opportunities: Sarah from ABC Company downloads your whitepaper and becomes a Marketing Qualified Lead. Two weeks later, Jim from ABC Company requests a demo. Your system flags him as a duplicate because the company already has an active lead.",
      "Jim’s demo request gets deprioritized or ignored entirely. Meanwhile, your competitor using account-based intelligence sees Sarah and Jim as buying group signals — technical evaluator plus economic buyer — and immediately coordinates targeted outreach to both stakeholders.",
      "Your system was designed to eliminate duplicates. Their system was designed to detect buying groups. Guess who wins the deal?",
      "Missing the forest for the trees | Lead-centric dashboards show you individual trees while your competitors see the entire forest. You track lead volume, conversion rates, and time to MQL. They track account-level engagement patterns, buying group formation, and cross-stakeholder influence.",
      "When five people from the same account visit your pricing page in the same week, your system sees five individual sessions. Your competitor’s system sees a buying committee in active evaluation and triggers coordinated engagement across all stakeholders.",
      "The competitive disadvantage compounds over time. Traditional reporting tells you about leads. Account-based reporting tells you about opportunities your competitors are already pursuing.",
      "Rather than replacing your existing tech stack, 6sense acts as thecentral intelligence layer that unifies dataacross all your sales and marketing tools. Companies that make this integration don’t just improve their performance — they gain systematic advantages over competitors still trapped in data silos.",
      "While competitors struggle with fragmented data across multiple systems, companies with integrated 6sense stacks operate from unified intelligence.JAGGAERsolved their resource constraints by integrating 6sense with Folloze, Salesforce CRM, Pardot, Outreach, Qualified webchat, Google Analytics, and Looker Studio. This comprehensive integration delivered lower cost per qualified opportunity and real — time performance insights while competitors were still manually assembling account information.",
      "Dialpadachieved similar competitive advantages through strategic integration, reducing cost-per-click by 17% while increasing influenced form fills by 41% in a single quarter — efficiency gains that compound into sustainable market advantages.",
      "The speed of implementation advantage | Companies implementing 6sense achieve buying group capabilities in months, not quarters. This speed advantage creates early-mover benefits in their markets while competitors struggle with longer implementation cycles of traditional ABM platforms.",
      "Companies that successfully integrate 6sensewith their existing tech stackreport transformation patterns, including:",
      "FullStory’stransformation illustrates how breaking down technology silos enables buying group success. Before 6sense, their small team struggled to execute targeted campaigns and couldn’t identify which accounts were truly in-market.",
      "By replacing their previous ABM platform with 6sense and integrating it across their tech stack, they transformed from individual lead focus to comprehensive buying group engagement. The results speak to the business impact of proper platform integration:",
      "Their VP of Growth Marketing summarized the transformation: “Despite having a small team, we can now execute campaigns with greater precision and achieve remarkable results.”",
      "The integration approach transforms disconnected point solutions into a coordinated revenue engine where every tool operates from unified account intelligence. While competitors remain trapped in technology silos, companies with integrated 6sense platforms gain systematic advantages that compound over time.",
      "Intelligent Workflows: Automating buying group detection and engagement | Smart companies use workflow automation to systematically identify buying group members, coordinate multi — touch engagement, and maintain consistent messaging across all stakeholders throughout the entire journey.",
      "Intelligent Workflowsis 6sense’s drag-and-drop visual canvas that allows teams to map their entire go-to-market strategy and activate AI-driven automations that are highly personalized to individuals within buying groups.",
      "Unlike traditional marketing automation that reacts to form fills and email clicks, Intelligent Workflows proactively responds to buying signals and intent data. Teams use a visual interface to drag and drop triggers, decision points, and actions, creating sophisticated automation that can span multiple channels and tools.",
      "The visual strategy canvas | Complex buyer journeys can get messy and confusing quickly. Keeping track of all the triggers, decision points, and activations across multiple stakeholders often leads to breakdowns in execution and communication. Intelligent Workflows solves this by putting everything on a visual canvas where the entire team can understand the process — and executives can easily see and approve the strategy.",
      "Teams can build workflows that automatically detect when someone within their ICP is researching tracked keywords, then enroll them in targeted ad campaigns with educational content and resources that resonate with their specific role and buying stage. If they engage with content, the workflow can automatically acquire their contact information, add them to the CRM, and trigger personalized outreach through marketing automation platforms, sales engagement platforms, or conversational AI agents.",
      "The “intelligent” in Intelligent Workflows comes from its integration with 6sense’s broader platform intelligence. Every decision point and action is informed by real-time intent data, buying stage analysis, and account-level signals from theSignalverse™. This enables incredibly relevant experiences at each touchpoint — nothing generic.",
      "When someone from a target account researches competitive alternatives, the workflow might automatically trigger a competitive takeout campaign with messaging tailored to their role and research behavior. When multiple stakeholders from the same organization engage with content, the workflow can detect buying group formation and coordinate outreach across the entire committee.",
      "Beyond manual multithreading | Traditional multithreading is a manual process: sales reps research accounts, identify potential stakeholders, and reach out individually. This approach works for a handful of high-priority accounts, but it doesn’t scale.",
      "Intelligent Workflows changes the game by automating buying group detection and engagement at scale. Instead of hoping sales reps will manually identify and engage multiple stakeholders, smart workflows automatically identify buying group activity and trigger coordinated responses.",
      "The result is systematic multithreading that works across hundreds or thousands of accounts simultaneously, with consistent messaging and timing that manual processes can’t match.",
      "Scenario 1: Proactive buying group development | When Sarah, a Director of IT Operations at a Fortune 500 company, downloads your security whitepaper, an intelligent workflow triggers automations that:",
      "The goal isn’t just to nurture Sarah — it’s to introduce your solution to the entire potential buying committee while competitors are still focused on individual leads.",
      "Scenario 2: Coordinated buying group engagement | When the system identifies multiple people from the same organization showing research behavior, it automatically flags the account for buying group engagement and begins collecting additional intelligence about potential stakeholders.",
      "Journey stage-based content deliveryensures different stakeholders receive relevant information based on their role and the organization’s position in the buying journey. Technical evaluators get technical content. Economic buyers get business case materials. End users get implementation success stories.",
      "The key is that all content is coordinated and consistent, building a unified narrative across multiple stakeholders rather than sending disconnected messages.",
      "Cross-team coordinationbetween marketing and sales is simplified and made consistent when workflows detect buying group activity. Sales gets notified about account-level engagement patterns. Marketing adjusts messaging based on sales feedback. Both teams work from the same account intelligence.",
      "Follozedemonstrates the operational benefits of coordinated buying committee engagement. According toMelinda Monaco, Senior Director of Revenue Marketing and Operations: “The integration has not only made our marketing efforts more targeted and efficient but has also provided our sales teams with actionable insights, significantly enhancing our overall sales performance.”",
      "The results speak for themselves: this strategic approach has kept 88% of accounts in 6QA status; connecting with more buying team members has helped keep opportunities active.",
      "The key insight is that buying group engagement isn’t just about initial qualification — it’s about maintaining momentum throughout long, complex sales cycles. When multiple stakeholders remain engaged, deals stay active even when individual contacts change roles or priorities shift.",
      "Multithreading mastery: Practical strategies for engaging every stakeholder | Successful multithreading requires understanding different stakeholder roles, timing outreach appropriately, and building consensus rather than just collecting contacts.",
      "Mapping the buying group | Not all buying group members are created equal. Effective multithreading starts with understanding the different roles people play in B2B purchase decisions.",
      "Technical decision makersevaluate whether your solution actually works. They care about integration, security, scalability, and implementation complexity. They’re often the most thorough researchers and the most skeptical stakeholders.",
      "Business influencersevaluate whether your solution makes business sense. They care about ROI, competitive advantage, and strategic alignment. They’re typically focused on outcomes rather than features.",
      "End usersevaluate whether your solution makes their lives better. They care about ease of use, training requirements, and day-to-day impact. They’re often the most enthusiastic advocates when they see clear personal benefits.",
      "Executive sponsorsevaluate whether your solution fits into broader organizational priorities. They care about risk, resource allocation, and strategic positioning. They typically make the final decision but rely heavily on input from other stakeholders.",
      "Each stakeholder type needs different information, delivered in different ways, at different times in the process.",
      "Persona-based Engagement Strategies | Generic multithreading fails because it treats all stakeholders the same. Effective multithreading recognizes that different stakeholders have different needs, different concerns, and different communication preferences.",
      "Technical stakeholdersrespond to detailed, evidence-based content. They want whitepapers, technical specifications, security documentation, and implementation guides. They prefer email and direct communication.",
      "Business stakeholdersrespond to strategic, outcome-focused content. They want case studies, ROI calculators, analyst reports, and competitive comparisons. They often engage through LinkedIn and industry publications.",
      "Executive stakeholdersrespond to concise, high-level summaries. They want executive briefings, strategic overviews, and peer testimonials. They prefer in-person meetings and phone calls.",
      "The key is delivering content at the right time and in the right context while ensuring consistent messaging across all stakeholders.",
      "Solving the coordination challenge | Multithreading multiple stakeholders within the same organization creates a coordination challenge: how do you ensure consistent messaging while allowing for role-specific customization?",
      "The solution is coordinated personalization. All stakeholders should receive messages that reinforce the same core value proposition, but those messages should be customized for their specific role and concerns.",
      "When introducing your solution to a new account, technical stakeholders might receive detailed integration guides, business stakeholders might receive ROI case studies, and executive stakeholders might receive strategic overviews — but all three should reinforce the same fundamental value proposition and competitive positioning.",
      "Building champions, not just contacts | The goal of multithreading isn’t to collect stakeholder contacts — it’s to build stakeholder champions. Champions actively advocate for your solution within their organization. Contacts just respond to your outreach.",
      "Building champions requires understanding what each stakeholder cares about most and demonstrating how your solution addresses their specific concerns. It means providing value beyond your product — industry insights, best practices, peer connections, and strategic guidance.",
      "Intent signals for multithreading | The most effective multithreading combines proactive research with reactive intelligence. Intent signals help you identify which stakeholders are actively researching solutions and what specific topics they’re investigating.",
      "Keyword research patternscan reveal stakeholder roles. Someone researching integration requirements is likely a technical evaluator. Someone researching competitive alternatives is likely involved in vendor selection. Someone researching implementation timelines is likely focused on project planning.",
      "Website behavior patterns (on your siteandothers)reveal stakeholder engagement. Multiple people from the same organization visiting your pricing page indicates active evaluation. Multiple people attending your webinars signals coordinated research. Multiple people downloading similar content demonstrates shared priorities.",
      "These signals help you prioritize outreach and customize messaging based on demonstrated interest rather than assumed needs.",
      "Bonterracreated a systematic approach to multithreading coordination. The company “created POD models where AEs and BDRs meet weekly to discuss 6QAs and recent activities from key accounts, and next steps on multithreading. By working together, both teams aligned on account priorities and messaging, ensuring consistent outreach.”",
      "The key insight is that effective multithreading requires coordination between marketing and sales, not just within sales. When both teams understand account-level engagement patterns and stakeholder priorities, they can coordinate their efforts rather than duplicate or conflict with each other.",
      "Traditional lead-based metrics hide buying group progress.Companies need new measurement frameworksthat capture group engagement, account momentum, and stakeholder influence.",
      "Most B2B organizations still measure marketing success using individual lead metrics:MQL volume, cost per lead, lead-to-opportunity conversion rates. These metrics made sense when B2B buying was driven by individual decision makers.",
      "In the age of buying groups, these metrics are not just inadequate — they’re counterproductive. They incentivize behavior that optimizes for individual lead generation rather than buying group engagement.",
      "Consider two scenarios: Company A generates 100 MQLs from 100 different organizations. Company B generates 100 MQLs from 20 organizations (5 MQLs per organization). Traditional metrics suggest these companies are performing equally. Buying group reality suggests Company B is significantly outperforming Company A.",
      "Account-based measurement frameworks | Effective buying group measurement requires shifting focus from individual contacts to organizational accounts. This means tracking engagement patterns, stakeholder involvement, and account=level progression rather than individual lead behavior.",
      "Account engagement depthmeasures how many stakeholders from each target account are actively engaged with your marketing and sales efforts. Deep engagement across multiple stakeholders is a stronger predictor of opportunity creation than individual lead scores.",
      "Stakeholder coveragemeasures what percentage of key stakeholder types are engaged within each target account. Complete coverage across technical, business, and executive stakeholders suggests higher likelihood of purchase decision.",
      "Account progression velocitymeasures how quickly accounts move through buying journey stages when multiple stakeholders are engaged versus when only individual contacts are engaged.",
      "Leading vs. lagging indicators | Traditional B2B metrics are mostly lagging indicators: they tell you what happened after it happened. Buying group metrics can provide leading indicators that predict future performance.",
      "Multiple stakeholders researching similar topics is a leading indicator of active buying group formation. This typically happens weeks or months before anyone submits a demo request or responds to sales outreach.",
      "Cross-stakeholder content engagement is a leading indicator of internal consensus building. When technical and business stakeholders are consuming complementary content, it suggests coordinated evaluation rather than individual research.",
      "Anonymous account activity is a leading indicator of early-stage buying group formation. Multiple anonymous visitors from the same organization often precedes identified engagement by several weeks.",
      "The engagement depth metric | Total engagement across all stakeholders within an account is more predictive of purchase likelihood than individual engagement depth. This insight requires a fundamental shift in how we think about lead scoring and qualification.",
      "Instead of scoring individual leads based on individual behavior, account-based scoring evaluates cumulative engagement across all known and anonymous stakeholders within target accounts.",
      "This approach recognizes that buying group decisions are made collectively, not individually. The account with moderate engagement across five stakeholders is more likely to purchase than the account with deep engagement from one stakeholder.",
      "ROI measurement for buying group strategies | Proving the business case for buying group strategies requires understanding a fundamental truth: traditional MQL-based measurement systems fail at a 99% rate, while account-based approaches capture the signals that actually predict revenue.",
      "As Kerry Cunningham explains in his analysis of MQL effectiveness, lead-based processes “suck” because “they don’t work.” The failure rate for MQL conversion is approximately 99%, and despite years of effort from demand generation teams, improvements rarely exceed 3-5% in poorly run operations and 1-1.5% in well-run ones.",
      "The core issue: MQL-based models ignore the single most important fact of B2B buying — that B2B buying is done by groups of people working together. For most B2B companies, that group is in the double digits, and they all conduct research and leave digital footprints across the internet.",
      "Why account-based measurement works | Account-based measurement captures multiple layers of evidence about which accounts are in-market:",
      "Companies using account-based measurement can identify and prioritize true buying teams for sellers, while traditional MQL systems miss nearly all the important buying signals available.",
      "The competitive advantage of complete intelligence | The signals that MQL-focused competitors miss are critical for virtually all B2B buying and selling processes. This applies to mid-market, commercial, enterprise, and strategic segments.",
      "When you have two pre-MQLs from one organization and one MQL from another organization, account-based measurement systems correctly prioritize the account showing buying group activity. Traditional MQL systems will always prioritize the individual lead, missing the stronger revenue signal.",
      "Measuring what actually matters | Effective buying group measurement focuses on account-level progression rather than individual lead conversion. The key metrics include:",
      "Since nearly 97% of website traffic is anonymous, and a healthy portion comes from accounts actively shopping for solutions, companies that can identify and measure this activity gain significant competitive advantages.",
      "The business case for transformation | Companies that maintain lead-based measurement systems alongside account-based approaches often implement “double funnel” strategies. However, this approach fails to address the fundamental problem: if you continue to orient processes around MQLs, you’ll continue to miss nearly all the important buying signals and condemn that part of your revenue generation to mediocrity.",
      "The most successful companies recognize that unless you sell deals involving only one or two people, the most important measurement capability is identifying when you have multiple leads or unique visitors from the same organization — regardless of their individual MQL status.",
      "Organizations that don’t make this measurement transformation will find it increasingly difficult to compete.",
      "Conclusion: The competitive advantage of buying group mastery | The companies that master buying group engagement will dominate their markets. While competitors chase individual leads, buying group masters build deeper relationships, faster pipelines, and more predictable revenue growth.",
      "This isn’t about incremental improvement — it’s about fundamental competitive advantage. When you understand and engage buying groups effectively, you don’t just win more deals. You win better deals, faster deals, and more profitable deals.",
      "The research is clear, the customer stories are compelling, and the technology is available. What separates winners from losers isn’t access to information or tools — it’s willingness to challenge assumptions and change approaches.",
      "The question isn’t whether to embrace buying groups — it’s how quickly you can transform your approach to capture this competitive advantage. The companies that act on these insights in the next 90 days will be the ones setting the pace in their markets over the next 90 months. The time for buying group mastery is now.",

      "The hidden cost of lead-centric thinking | Every day you focus on individual MQLs, you’re missing signals from 80% of the actual buying team.

However, we now know from market research, that these larger companies are no longer making single- person decisions. It’s a group decision by a buying team.”",
      "The cost of technology misalignment | Before FullStory implemented 6sense, their marketing team was trapped in what their VP of Growth Marketing calls a “spray-and-pray” approach. Despite having talented people and solid content, they couldn’t see buying group formation or coordinate engagement across multiple stakeholders. Individual leads came and went, but pipeline remained unpredictable.",

    "p": [
      "What is demand generation? | Demand generation is the strategic, integrated approach to creating awareness, interest, and engagement around your products or services with the ultimate goal of driving revenue. | B2B purchase decisions are made collectively by teams, not individuals. | Most buying activity happens anonymouslybefore any form is filled out.",
      "While often mistakenly reduced to simply “lead generation,” true demand generation encompasses the entire revenue journey— from initial awareness to closed deals and beyond.",
      "For B2B organizations, particularly those with complex sales cycles, demand generation serves as the engine that powers sustainable growth. It’s not just about filling the top of the funnel with prospects; it’s about cultivating genuine interest that converts to pipeline opportunities and, ultimately, revenue.",
      "Modern B2B demand generation is about identifying and engaging buying groups — not just individual leads — at the right moment in their journey with messaging that resonates with their specific needs. This approach recognizes that:",
      "What is B2B demand generation? | B2B demand generation focuses specifically on creating awareness and interest among potential business buyers. Unlike B2C marketing, which targets individual consumers, B2B demand generation must account for:",
      "Example: A cybersecurity software company implements a B2B demand generation strategy that includes:",
      "Rather than simply collecting contact information, they focus on identifying accounts showing active research on security solutions and engaging entire buying committees with relevant messaging.",
      "What is demand generation marketing? | Demand generation marketing refers to the collective marketing activities designed to create awareness and interest among potential buyers. It blends art and science — combining compelling messaging and creative with data-driven targeting and measurement.",
      "Effective B2B demand generation marketing recognizes thatprospects don’t move linearly through a funnelbut rather engage in various touchpoints across channels before making a purchase decision. It requires both strategic planning and tactical execution across multiple channels, including:",
      "The goal is not just to generate leads but to create genuine interest and demand for your solutions among the accounts most likely to purchase.",
      "From outbound to inbound: The historical perspective | Originally, B2B demand generation relied heavily on outbound tactics like cold calling, mass mailing, and trade shows. Success was often measured by the volume of leads passed to sales, regardless of quality or buyer-readiness.",
      "In the 2000s, as digital channels emerged, inbound marketing gained prominence. Organizations began focusing on pulling prospects through content marketing rather than pushing messages outward. Lead scoring systems were developed to gauge interest levels based on demographic data and engagement metrics.",
      "However, both approaches were centered on the individual lead, which created fundamental disconnects with how B2B purchasing actually happens.",
      "Research from Forrester has documented for over a decade that B2B buying has always been a team sport. Former Forester analyst and 6sense Head of Thought Leadership Kerry Cunningham took a fresh look at the evolution of B2B buying behavior by interviewing over 2,500 recent buyers. One insight from hisB2B Buyer Experience Report: Purchase decisions are now made by committees averaging 10-11 stakeholders across multiple departments.",
      "The current state of B2B demand generation | Today’s most advanced B2B demand generation programs have evolved in several critical ways:",
      "From lead-centric to account-based: Only about 3% of web visitors convert to form-fills, with up to 90% of identifiable account visitors remaining anonymous throughout their buying journeys. This data has driven a shift toward account-based strategies thatuse intent dataand other buying signals to identify and engage entire buying groups, not just individuals who complete forms.",
      "From volume-focused to intent-driven: Rather than generating as many leads as possible, modern demand generation prioritizes identifying accounts showing genuine buying signals. According to the Buyer Experience Report, on average only about 5-7% of a company’s target accounts are actively in-market for solutions during any given quarter. Focusing on these high-intent accounts dramatically improves conversion rates and sales efficiency.",
      "From siloed departments to aligned revenue teams: Best-in-class organizations have broken down the traditional barriers between marketing, sales, and customer success to create unified revenue teams working toward shared goals.",
      "From MQLs to MQAs: Instead of Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs), leading companies focus on Marketing Qualified Accounts (MQAs) that demonstrate collective buying intent across multiple stakeholders. Companies that have implemented account-based programs report significant increases in average deal size.",

      "Morningstar was able to leverage AI andpredictive modelsto better understand their customers and target them more effectively.",
      "1. Shifting From brand-focused to customer-focused marketing | When a brand starts, it makes sense to do some work with brand- and feature-focused marketing. That’s foundational awareness work a company can build on.",
      "But to reach beyond those fundamentals, companies need to also reach prospects with information that directly connects value to need. You need to understand pain points and address them.",
      "“The more targeted you are, the more relevant you are to your customer, the more you’re customer-centric, it allows you to have better engagement overall. You’re not spraying and praying with digital ads, people who don’t even care to see your message,” Kabashi explained.",
      "2. Align sales and marketing motions to scale | Audience segmentation sharpens campaign focus for marketers, and alerts help sales reps understand who to call and when.",
      "These techniques pay off in increased purchase opportunities and improved engagement with your target audience.",
      "As soon as they saw the results, Morningstar’s sales team wanted more, Kabashi said. “They wanted to know, ‘How do we get access to this data more frequently? How do we get a sales intelligence widget?’’ ‘How do we get alerts?’”",
      "Giving sales access to ademand gen dashboardto help them drive even more outcomes was a win across the revenue team.",
      "3. Pilot and expand strategically | If you have multiple audience segments and/or multiple products, you don’t have to deploy your demand generation strategy across all of them at one time.",
      "Morningstar, for instance, started with one value proposition on their flagship product to use as a test attractor, and as that campaign saw success, expanded — and continues to expand — with messaging, products, targets, and lines of business.",
      "But the buy-in yielded from the success of those first efforts means the entire revenue team is on board for these future efforts.",

      "How to build a demand generation strategy | Creating an effective B2B demand generation strategy requires a systematic approach. Here’s a framework based on 6sense’s methodology:",
      "1. Define your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) | Start by clearly defining the characteristics of organizations that represent your best-fit customers:",
      "Beyond defining your ICP, 6sense recommends creating a Dynamic Target Account List that uses AI to identify which accounts within your ICP are currently showing buying signals—what they term the “in-market ICP.” This focused approach ensures resources are concentrated on accounts with the highest likelihood of purchase.",
      "2. Map buying committee roles | B2B purchases involve multiple stakeholders with different priorities and concerns. According to the 2024 Buyer Experience Report, the typical B2B buying group consists of 10-11 decision makers, with complex B2B purchases involving significantly more stakeholders. Identify the key roles typically involved in purchasing your solution:",
      "Understanding the composition of typical buying groups allows you to create content and engagement strategies that address the specific concerns of each stakeholder.",
      "3. Analyze the buyer’s journey | Document how buying committees move from problem awareness to purchase decision:",
      "The 2024 Buyer Experience Report shows companies must engage prospects much earlier than traditionally thought. Their data indicates buyers are typically 69% through their journey before engaging with sales, making early, anonymous-stage engagement critical.",
      "4. Develop a multi-channel engagement plan | Create coordinated touchpoints across channels to engage target accounts at each stage of their journey:",
      "The key is orchestrating these touchpoints to create a cohesive experience for buying committee members as they move through their journey. 6sense’s platform enables this orchestration by triggering appropriate actions based on account buying stages and engagement signals.",
      "5. Implement account scoring and routing processes | Establish processes to evaluate account engagement and readiness for sales conversations:",
      "6sense recommends moving beyond traditional lead scoring to AI-driven predictions that consider buying group engagement patterns, intent signals, and historical conversion data to identify which accounts are truly in-market.",
      "The focus should be on measuring impact throughout the revenue funnel, not just at the top — tracking how demand generation activities influence pipeline creation, acceleration, and closed revenue.",
      "To maximize the effectiveness of your B2B demand generation efforts, follow thesebest practicesinformed by 6sense’s research and customer success stories:",
      "1. Focus on in-market accounts | Not all companies in your target market are actively looking to buy. Only 5-7% of accounts in your total addressable market are in-market at any given time. By identifying and prioritizing these in-market accounts, you can:",
      "Use intent data and predictive analytics to identify which accounts are showing active buying signals rather than spreading resources thinly across your entire database.",
      "2. Engage anonymous buyers early | The vast majority of B2B research happens anonymously. According to the Buyer Experience Report, B2B buyers consume an average of 17 content pieces per vendor before deciding, with most of this research happening anonymously.",
      "Buyers resist filling out forms, sothe common tactic of hiding valuable content behind a contact form is self-defeating. Youwantbuyers to read your content so they can build affinity and earn consideration.",
      "Buyers spend only 30% of their purchase journey meeting with potential suppliers, and81% of buyers have picked a winner before they even speak with a sales rep.",
      "Early engagement gives you the opportunity to shape buying criteria before competitors have a chance to establish themselves as the preferred choice.",
      "3. Personalize at the account and persona level | Generic messaging no longer resonates with sophisticated B2B buyers. Effective personalization includes:",
      "6sense’s orchestration capabilities can help deliver the right message to the right person at the right time, based on their role in the buying process and their account’s buying stage.",
      "4. Coordinate multi-channel outreach | B2B buying groups consume information across multiple channels. Coordinated multi-channel campaigns create reinforcing touchpoints:",
      "The key is ensuring consistency across channels while tailoring the approach to each channel’s strengths.",
      "5. Align content to buying stages | Different content formats and topics resonate at different stages of the buying process:",
      "6sense recommends mapping content to buying stages and then using AI-driven predictive analytics to deliver the right content based on an account’s current stage.",
      "7. Measure what matters | Focus on metrics that connect to revenue outcomes rather than activity metrics:",
      "6sense’s analytics capabilities help organizations track and attribute revenue impact across the entire customer journey, from anonymous research to closed deals.",

      "The anonymity gap: B2B buying groups conduct the first 70% of their research journey anonymously and make key decisions about which vendors they’ll consider during this selection phase. And only a tiny fraction of people who visit your website will even fill out a form. If you wait for people to fill out forms, you will miss many potential customers and will also forfeit most of your opportunity to influence buying decisions. | The buying group reality: The average B2B purchase involves 10-11 decision makers. Lead generation focuses on capturing individual contacts, providing an incomplete picture of account engagement. | The bad timing/bad lead paradox: The B2B Buyer Experience Report shows that buyersdon’t want to talk to salesuntil they’re ready. If you rely on contact forms and gated content, some motivated prospects will fill out the form just to get the information they need to continue their independent research. What happens next? A seller calls and emails and texts the “lead,” and gets no response. The lead is written off as “bad.” But that’s not always the right assessment. Often, sellers are simply reaching out to future buyersbeforethey’re ready to buy.Goodleads get abandoned. | The quality issue: The average conversion rate from marketing-qualified lead (MQL) to closed deal is remarkably inefficient, creating a lot of thankless work for sales teams who spend inordinate amounts of time filtering out low quality leads."

      "Introduction | Winning business from competitors isn’t just about proving superiority. It’s about understanding when prospects are vulnerable to switching, what motivates that switch, and how to position your solution as the better choice. | Identify competitive opportunities | Craft winning positioning, and | Execute campaigns that convert prospects away from competitors.",
      "Competitive takeoutcampaigns are fundamentally different from standard lead generation. They target accounts actively evaluating alternatives, address specific switching concerns, and require precise timing to catch prospects when they’re genuinely open to changing course.",
      "Understand your competitive landscape | Before launching any competitive campaign, you need intelligence about who you’re really competing against and when prospects are most receptive to switching.",
      "Identifying your true competitorsgoes beyond the obvious direct competitors in your category. Map three types of competitive threats:",
      "Each competitor type requires different messaging approaches and timing strategies. Direct competitors need differentiation messaging, indirect competitors need category education, and status quo competitors need urgency and ROI justification.",
      "Research competitor messaging and positioningby analyzing their website copy, case studies, sales collateral, and social media content. Pay attention to how they frame problems, what outcomes they promise, and which customer segments they prioritize. This intelligence reveals positioning gaps you can exploit and messages that resonate with your shared target market.",
      "Monitor competitor activitiesthrough social listening, industry publications, and review sites. Track their product releases, partnership announcements, leadership changes, and customer feedback patterns. These insights reveal timing opportunities and competitive vulnerabilities you can leverage.",
      "Intent signalsprovide early alerts when accounts begin researching alternatives. These signals often appear months before prospects contact vendors directly, giving you a significant head start on competitive opportunities.",
      "Look for accounts showing research activity around competitor names, competitive comparison terms, or solution categories where multiple vendors compete.",
      "Defining your competitive advantage | Successful competitive positioning doesn’t attack competitors directly. Instead, it frames your unique value in ways that make competitor alternatives appear less attractive by comparison.",
      "Crafting differentiated value propositionsrequires understanding what prospects value most when evaluating alternatives. B2B buyers prioritize different factors depending on their role and buying stage:",
      "Develop role-specific value propositions that highlight your solution’s advantages in terms each stakeholder group cares about most.",
      "Address competitor weaknesses without direct attacksby emphasizing areas where your solution excels while competitors struggle. Frame these as positive capabilities rather than negative competitor commentary. Instead of “Competitor X lacks advanced analytics,” position your message as “Built-in predictive analytics help you anticipate customer needs before they arise.”",
      "Create compelling switching narrativesthat acknowledge switching costs while demonstrating superior outcomes. Address implementation concerns, data migration challenges, and learning curve issues proactively. Prospects evaluating alternatives are already aware of switching costs — your job is showing why the long-term benefits outweigh short-term disruption.",
      "Competitive messaging that doesn’t sound competitivefocuses on outcomes rather than comparisons. Lead with customer success stories, quantified results, and unique capabilities that deliver measurable value. When prospects can clearly see superior outcomes, they draw competitive conclusions naturally without defensive reactions.",
      "Address switching costs and implementation concernsdirectly in your messaging. Prospects worry about disruption, learning curves, and integration challenges. Develop content that demonstrates smooth transitions, showcases implementation success stories, and provides realistic timelines for value realization.",
      "Build trust with prospects evaluating alternativesby providing transparent, educational content that helps them make informed decisions. Offer unbiased comparison frameworks, honest discussions of solution trade-offs, and realistic expectations for implementation and results. Prospects appreciate vendors who help them evaluate options objectively rather than pushing for immediate decisions.",
      "Campaign strategy and planning | The audience for competitive campaigns require some strategic shifts. They are already highly educated about solutions, more sophisticated in their evaluation criteria, and often more resistant to marketing messages.",
      "Prospects actively evaluating multiple vendors need comparison-focused content, implementation guidance, and validation through case studies from similar organizations. They’re typically earlier in relationships with competitors and more open to alternatives.",
      "Existing competitor customers face higher switching costs and have established relationships. They need compelling reasons to reconsider their current solution, often triggered by unmet needs, strategic changes, or competitive disadvantages they’re experiencing.",
      "Buying stage considerationssignificantly impact competitive campaign effectiveness. Accounts in early awareness stages may not yet recognize the need for alternatives, while accounts in active evaluation stages are comparing specific options and ready for detailed competitive conversations.",
      "Use buying stage intelligenceto time competitive messaging appropriately. Early-stage accounts benefit from thought leadership content that subtly highlights your differentiators. Late-stage accounts need direct comparison tools, implementation planning resources, and proof points that support switching decisions.",
      "Account prioritizationfor competitive plays should consider both opportunity size and competitive displacement likelihood.

      "Hope is helpful when launching a new product or entering a new market, but it’s not a strategy. Yet countless organizations do so with little more than crossed fingers and optimistic sales projections. For every market success, multiple failures lurk in the shadows: products that missed their revenue targets, failed to gain traction, or simply disappeared without a trace. | Who will buy our solution? | Why will they buy it? | How will we reach them? | What will it cost? | How will we sell it?",
      "What separates the breakout successes from the forgotten failures? More often than not, it’s a meticulously crafted go-to-market (GTM) strategy that makes the difference. The most successful B2B organizations approach market entry not as a single event but as a comprehensive, cross-functional campaign with clearly defined targets, messaging, channels, and metrics.",
      "Whether you’re preparing to launch your first product, expanding into new market segments, or seeking to revitalize your existing approach to market entry, we’ve got the framework, insights, and practical steps needed from evolving your strategy from a stale document into a dynamic engine for sustainable growth.",
      "What is a go-to-market strategy? | A go-to-market strategy is a comprehensive, actionable plan that outlines exactly how a company will successfully introduce a new product or service to its target market. For B2B organizations — particularly in SaaS — a GTM strategy serves as a roadmap to bridge the gap between product development and revenue generation.",
      "Unlike general business plans that cover broad operations, GTM strategies focus specifically on the coordinated approach to reaching, communicating value, and establishing market presence and answers fundamental questions:",
      "For SaaS companies, a well-crafted GTM strategy is particularly important given the complex sales cycles, multiple stakeholders, and subscription-based revenue models that characterize the industry.",
      "Go-to-market strategy vs. marketing strategy | GTM strategies and marketing strategies serve distinct purposes in the B2B ecosystem.",
      "Scope and focus | A go-to-market strategy is laser-focused on the successful introduction of a specific offering — whether it’s a new product or service or entry into a new market segment. It’s time-bound, product-specific, and designed with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Think of it as the roadmap for a particular journey rather than the overall transportation system.",
      "A marketing strategy is broader in scope, encompassing an organization’s overarching approach to creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers across all products and services. It’s ongoing, brand-centric, and establishes the foundation for all marketing activities.",
      "Timeframe and lifecycle | A GTM strategy typically aligns with the product lifecycle, with particular emphasis on the launch and early growth phases. It’s designed to create initial market traction and establish product-market fit within a defined timeframe — usually measured in months rather than years.",
      "Marketing strategies operate on a longer timeline, evolving with the company’s overall business objectives and market positioning. They provide continuity across multiple GT< initiatives and product cycles, measured in years and focused on long-term brand equity.",
      "Team involvement | One of the most distinctive characteristics of a GTM strategy is its cross-functional nature. While marketing teams certainly play a critical role, successful GTM execution requires active participation from product, sales, customer success, pricing, and operations teams. Each function contributes specialized expertise to ensure alignment across the customer journey.",
      "Marketing strategies, while requiring input from other departments, are primarily owned and executed by the marketing organization, with accountability for brand positioning, demand generation, and marketing communications.",
      "How they work together | GTM and marketing strategies should be complementary rather than competitive. Your marketing strategy establishes the foundation — market positioning, value proposition, and brand voice — upon which effective GTM strategies are built.",
      "Similarly, insights gained during GTM execution inform refinements to the broader marketing strategy. For example, messaging that resonates strongly during a product launch might be incorporated into overall brand communications, while underperforming channels identified during GTM execution might be de-emphasized in the broader marketing mix.",
      "Key elements of a B2B go-to-market strategy | A successful B2B GTM plan requires meticulous planning across multiple dimensions. Approaches will vary based on industry, product complexity, and market maturity, but these elements form the foundation of any effective strategy.",
      "1. Target market definition | The cornerstone of any GTM plan is a precisely defined target market — the specific subset of potential customers who are most likely to derive value from your offering and convert into paying customers. This definition should include:",
      "This target market definition should be narrow enough to focus resources but broad enough to support growth objectives.",
      "2. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) | Building on your target market definition, your ICP narrows broad market segments into detailed organizational personas that exemplify your perfect customers. An ICP includes:",
      "For B2B SaaS companies, ICPs should also include critical adoption factors like implementation complexity, user sophistication requirements, and integration dependencies.",
      "3. Buyer personas | While ICPs focus on organizational fit, buyer personas drill down to the individual stakeholders involved in the purchasing decision. In B2B environments, the buying committee typically includes six to 10 decision makers, each with distinct priorities and concerns. Comprehensive buyer personas should capture:",
      "Developing separate personas for economic buyers, technical evaluators, end users, and executive sponsors ensures your messaging resonates with each stakeholder’s unique perspective.",
      "4. Value proposition and messaging framework | Your value proposition articulates why your target customers should choose your solution over alternatives — including the status quo. An effective B2B value proposition:",
      "Adapt this core value proposition for different buyer personas and stages of the customer journey through a comprehensive messaging framework that ensures consistency while allowing for contextual relevance.",
      "5. Competitive positioning | Understanding your competitive landscape is essential for effective differentiation. Your competitive positioning should:",
      "The optimal mix depends on factors like solution complexity, typical deal size, implementation requirements, and customer buying preferences.",
      "7. Pricing model | Your pricing strategy must balance market competitiveness, value perception, and financial objectives. Key considerations include:",
      "Be sure to also account for implementation costs, onboarding investments, and customer success resources required to ensure adoption.",
      "8. Sales process and enablement | Even the best GTM plan falters without effective sales execution. It should define:",
      "For complex sales cycles, special attention should be given to defining handoff points between marketing, sales development, and account executives to ensure seamless customer experiences.",
      "10. Success metrics and measurement framework | Finally, your plan must establish clear success criteria and measurement methodologies:",
      "Ago-to-market strategyaligns well with an Account-Based Marketing (ABM) approach. ABM’s precision targeting enhances traditional GTM execution by focusing resources on high-value accounts with the greatest revenue potential.",
      "Modern ABM platforms like 6sense can improve a business’s GTM strategy, using AI-driven intent data to identify when prospects are actively researching solutions and enabling marketing and sales teams to engage high-value accounts at the right point in their buying journey.",
      "ABM-enhanced GTM strategies typically use a tiered approach that balances customization with scalability:",
      "Go-to-market strategy is both a discipline and a skill that can be developed through practice and experience. It requires the ability to synthesize market research, competitive intelligence, customer insights, and cross-functional coordination into a cohesive execution plan.",
      "A B2B SaaS go-to-market strategy is a specialized approach designed for software-as-a-service companies selling to business customers. It typically emphasizes product-led growth, free trials or freemium models, recurring revenue optimization, and strategies for reducing customer acquisition costs while maximizing lifetime value.",
      "A classic example is Slack’s initial GTM approach, which focused on launching within small teams at larger organizations to demonstrate value before expanding company-wide. They combined a freemium model with viral growth mechanics, allowing satisfied users to naturally advocate for broader adoption within their organizations.",

    "title": "How the MQL-Industrial Complex Accidentally Set B2B Buyers Free | 6sense",
    "meta_description": "B2B marketing built the MQL machine to capture buyers—but it empowered them instead. Here's how content marketing unintentionally rewired the journey.",
    "p": [
      "In the pre-internet era, enterprise buyers were tethered to sellers. If you wanted to understand a complex business solution — what it did, how it worked, what it cost — you had to talk to sales. Sellers controlled the information. Marketing’s job was to shape brand image and pique curiosity just enough to get buyers into that conversation.",
      "But then something strange happened. In its push to generate more leads, B2B marketing built a machine that would ultimately liberate the buyer from the very dependency it relied on. The internet, powered by content marketing and syndication channels, transformed the buyer-seller relationship — and not quite the way marketing automation vendors had in mind.",
      "The Rise of the MQL Industrial Complex | Content marketing emerged from a need to fuel lead machines, not educate buyers. Marketing automation platforms prompted the question: “What content will get people to fill out a form?”",
      "The goal was conversion, not knowledge. The fallacy was that capturing these names and email addresses would initiate engagement and start both the buying journey and the sales cycle –that real decision-making would begin only after interaction.",
      "An industry arose around content syndication, gated eBooks, webinars, whitepapers, and comparison guides — each designed to trigger a form submission and supposedly catalyze a sales handoff.",
      "But buyers saw it differently. They always have. Content living online became a toolkit. They could start their journeys without sellers, and they liked it that way.",
      "From Dependency to Independence | Before content marketing and the internet, B2B buyers had no choice but to engage sellers early. Sellers held the pricing sheets. Sellers explained implementation. Sellers curated the shortlist.",
      "But the spread of digital information flipped that dynamic. Today, a buyer can discover a category, identify top players, compare capabilities, read customer reviews, vet partners, and build internal consensus — all before a single sales conversation.",
      "Content syndicators, analyst firms, product review sites, and even peer Slack channels now form a sprawling, decentralized information ecosystem. In many ways, this is the real “buyer enablement” story — not a set of tools vendors built for their customers, but a network buyers built for themselves (hat tip to Forrester, which is doing really interesting work on buyer networks).",
      "This shift fundamentally decoupled the buying journey from the sales cycle. The two may eventually converge, but they rarely begin together anymore.",
      "One of the most consequential effects of this buyer independence is thatbuying processes start long before sellers are aware of them.",
      "This dislocation — this temporal disjunction — means that sales teams are walking into stories already in progress. The RFP isn’t the beginning of discovery. It’s the tail end of preference formation.",
      "In this model, the traditional “top of funnel” doesn’t exist from the buyer’s perspective. If a buyer shows up in your CRM, it means they’ve already decided you might be in contention. Everything before that was invisible to you — but critical to them.",
      "The other overlooked factor here is theexperience level of B2B buyers. Preliminary data from current studies suggests that most enterprise buyers are seasoned veterans — often in their 40s and 50s — with years of experience running evaluation processes.",
      "They’re not coming to the table wide-eyed. They’ve seen multiple platforms. They’ve made implementation mistakes. They know the difference between vaporware and value.",
      "So when these buyers do engage content, it’s not to learn a category from scratch. It’s tobrush up on key developments,validate gut instincts, andarm themselves for internal debates. Content doesn’t shape preferences — it reinforces them.",
      "This is why so many late-stage content assets that vendors obsess over — battle cards, ROI calculators, implementation roadmaps — don’t shift outcomes. By the time they’re consumed, the buyer has already made up their mind. But that doesn’t mean they’re acting alone. These buyers — often the internal champions who already prefer your solution — are using these assets to win over the skeptics and partisans within their organizations. The content isn’t there to change their mind; it’s there to help them change someone else’s.",
      "The Ironic Legacy of Content Marketing | So here’s the irony: the MQL Industrial Complex was built to trap buyers. But it ended up empowering them. The gates around content slowed them down — but didn’t stop them. Instead, they built their own paths around those gates.",
      "Today, content exists in a de facto public commons — aggregated, summarized, quoted, reviewed, and repurposed. AI will only accelerate this.",
      "And now we face a new reality: marketing’s real job isn’t to catch buyers — it’s tomotivate them —to boost the motivated reasoning of those who already prefer you. As discussed in our earlier piece on motivated reasoning, buyers aren’t neutral actors; they interpret information in ways that reinforce their existing preferences. Your content and experiences need to continually bolster that reasoning — helping internal champions not only view your solution in the best possible light, but also giving them the confidence and ammunition to advocate forcefully for you inside their organizations. The age of capture has given way to the age of enablement and motivation.",
      "But many B2B teams are still playing by the old rules.",
      "Time to Rewire Our Assumptions | The decoupling of the buying journey and the sales cycle is not a bug. It’s a feature of the modern B2B landscape. Buyers don’t want to be nurtured through funnels. They insist on navigating their own journey, with the option to reach out when they’re ready. Your job is to motivate them.",
      "This means the most impactful marketing isn’t the kind that captures contact info. It’s the kind that helps buyers win their internal conversations —whether or not they ever fill out a form.",
      "Ironically, the most buyer-centric thing marketers can do today may be to stop trying to “generate demand” and start understanding where buyers already are, what they already know, and what will motivate them to continue along in their journeys.",
      "The MQL machine won’t help you do that. But your content might — if you let it.",

    "meta_description": "Most B2B buyers choose a vendor before sales begins. This piece explores how the sales cycle functions as confirmation—not discovery—and what to do about it.",
    "p": [
      "For example, when we look out at the worldthrough our eyes(or listen with our ears, or use any of our other senses), it feels like we are seeing the worldas it is. But neuroscience tells us that’s not how perception works. We don’t passively receive reality—wepredictit.",
      "How old were you when you learned that the chair you were sitting on so securely was not really solid, but composed of billions of atoms held together by faint electrical charges? Or that the gentle, tasteless water you take for granted can corrode metal, bore through stone, and even reshape entire landscapes?",
      "Our intuitions are often at odds with how the world actually works—and how we perceive the world is no exception.",
      "Our brains are continually running internal models, using past experiences to anticipate what should be coming next. Then, our sensory input is compared to those expectations. In most cases, the match is good enough, and we move on without even noticing. When there’s a mismatch—something unexpected, unfamiliar, or incongruent—that’s when the brain lights up, revises the model, and updates perception.",
      "This theory—calledpredictive processing—suggests that perception is essentially a controlled hallucination. Most of what we “see” is what weexpectto see, filled in by memory and filtered through context.",
      "The B2B sales cycle is one of those things that feels intuitive—but the data tells a different story.",
      "We’ve long assumed that B2B buying decisions are made during the formal sales process. That’s when competing sales teams respond to inquiries, conduct discovery, pitch solutions, and try to win the deal. But across thousands of buying journeys, a different picture emerges: in about 80% of B2B purchases, the choice is madebeforethe seller ever enters the picture.",
      "So, it’s beyond reasonable doubt: in most buying journeys,the decision has already been shaped by the time sellers arrive. In our own research, we see that inroughly 81% of buying journeys, buyers have a preferred vendor identified before they ever fill out a form, request a demo, or take a call.",
      "The last part of the buying journey—what we typically call the sales cycle—is not a gladiator match between vendors. Itlookslike a competition. But in reality, it functions more like a validation ritual. Each vendor is invited to perform, but the starring role has already been cast.",
      "It probably hasn’t always been this way. Before the internet and content marketing liberated buyers from dependence on sellers, the sales process played a more central role. Even then, buyers carried their biases—but sellers had more control over the flow of information. That is certainly no longer the case.",
      "Today, by the time buyers engage with sellers, they’ve already aligned as a group. What happens next is governed bymotivated reasoning. Buyers don’t evaluate vendors with open minds; they reinforce the story they’ve already started telling themselves.",
      "From that point forward, the brain predicts it will like what it sees and hears from the chosen vendor—and that’s what happens (link).",
      "Just as the brain confirms what it expects to perceive,buyers enter the sales cycle trying to confirm the choice they’ve already made.",
      "Buyers are not seeking truth—they’re seekingcoherence. They want their internal story to make sense.",
      "In other words: if you wait until the sales cycle to win the buyer’s mind, you’re too late. The perception has already been formed. And just like with visual illusions, even when youknowsomething’s off, your brain still sees what it expects to see.",
      "Afterword: What About Sellers? | You might be wondering: does this mean the whole sales process is a waste of time?",
      "In our research,sellers directly influence buyer choice during the sales cycle in about 20% of deals. That’s meaningful. And sales organizations should be trying to increase the percentage of deals in which they skirt the rules given above.",
      "And therein lies the paradox: the more you accept that the buyer has already made up their mind, the more clearly you can see how to influence what happens next.",

      "Marketing’s job is to shape narratives and motivate reasoning. If you’re not influencing the mental model buyers carry into the sales process, you’re already behind. | Optimize for consensus. Winning vendors are often those that seem least risky to the entire buying group. Marketing builds consensus with content and experiences tailored to each key persona. | Sales should identify positioning and prioritize efforts. Sellers need to assess where they stand on the shortlist—and act accordingly. | Enablement must support internal storytelling. Buyers need more than reasons to believe—they need reasons to defend their choice internally.",

Attribution systems often assign undue credit to the last tactic – the freeloading bystander — that occurs before buyer engagement, whether it’s an email, BDR outreach, or an ad. | Why attribution is broken: how the last tactic to prompt engagement freeloads off prior efforts | New data on the true duration and dynamics of modern B2B buying journeys | The distinction between the decision and purchase stages — and why it matters | What 11-person buying groups can teach us about brand preference and shortlisting | The misalignment between actual buyer behavior and typical marketing attribution models | Practical guidance for assigning marketing tactics to buying stages, not deals",
      "But by the time a buyer engages, the favorite vendor has already been chosen.

    "p": [
      "How Marketing Lost Its Way – and How AI Can Help Us Find It Again | When human societies transitioned from foraging to farming, the results were transformative –larger, more stable populations, the rise of cities, and eventually, modern civilizations. But the shift came with costs that were more difficult to see — but chronic and debilitating in many respects. These seemingly successful farmers developed rotten teeth, arthritis, their growth was stunted, and they regularly suffered deadly pandemics, as well – all of which were unknown to their forager forebears. | Technology-Driven Process Development:Marketing organizations invested heavily in technology and automation systems. These technologies were repurposed from contexts intended for individual consumer interactions. Marketers built processes that technology could enable, rather than technology that would enable the right processes. As a result, the focus shifted away from prospect as account to prospect as individual who responds, however slightly, to marketing ploys designed to induce a reaction. | Managing what is measurable.Likewise, rather than developing methods to measure the impact of brand development and buying group engagement on future revenue, organizations focused on the drive-thru measurements of MQL production and conversion. Soon, nearly all of marketing’s value was measured via the production and conversion of leads. | The MQL Industrial Complex:As more tools were developed and purchased, the process of generating leads became mechanized. Analyst firms brought optimization, measurement frameworks, and benchmarks. Rather than evaluating whether the MQL approach was appropriate, all focus was placed instead on process improvement within the MQL production paradigm. Instead of questioning how MQL conversions were related to revenue outcomes, organizations focused entirely on meeting and surpassing peer-benchmarks for MQL conversion. This is the essence of what many term the “MQL-Industrial complex.” | Misalignment with Buyer Needs:Buying groups in B2B must overcome differing perspectives on their organization’s needs, fickle budgets, and the countless other demands for their time and attention to come to consensus on a viable solution to their business needs. What serves these buyers best are providers that communicate clearly about their solutions to relevant business needs, and which make information buyers need easy to comprehend and freely available. The MQL-driven approach makes acquiring contact information rather than enabling buyers the key goal of marketing tactics.",
      "It has taken roughly 10,000 years, but we are coming to realize that our diets and lifestyles must contain elements that were present for our foraging ancestors. The solution, of course, is not to go back to foraging, but to understand how to evolve modern, agriculture-based diets and lifestyles to accommodate current knowledge about health and nutrition.",
      "In B2B marketing, instead of transforming from forager to farmer, B2B marketers have transformed from artisans to factory workers (and bosses). What began as a nuanced, relationship-driven craft became an industrialized system optimized for producing MQLs. This shift drove scale and efficiency, but not without cost. Revenue teams have grown sick from the sugary diet of MQLs that lack nutritional value. BDR bellies have been full, even while pipelines were starved for real buyers. And much of what made marketing effective — brand, trust, buyer preference — was lost in the bargain.",
      "We don’t need 10,000 years to learn our lesson — the past twenty have been more than enough. And today, we have AI to spur rapid change.",
      "In this article, we will briefly survey how B2B revenue teams got to this state, then outline how AI can help us rapidly evolve away from the hyper-industrialized form of marketing that predominates today toward an even more effective post-industrial state that uses AI to manage the industrial components of marketing, while creating space for marketing artisans to create the value-providing, relationship building brands that drive consistent growth.",
      "A Brief History of B2B Marketing | Pre-1995: Artisanal Marketing Before the mid-90s, marketing was largely an artisanal practice. Organizations relied on a mix of personalized, relationship-based tactics and hand-crafted strategies. Rather than being tasked primarily with identifying and wrangling buyers, marketers were entrusted with the development and promotion of the brand in the marketplace. They were storytellers and relationship cultivators who worked with relatively limited technological assistance, focusing on building brands that buyers could relate to and trust.",
      "Transformation with Email and Early Digital Technologies The advent of email and early digital tools introduced a paradigm shift. These technologies were originally designed for one-to-one communication, where the buyer was typically an individual. As these tools scaled, they began to shape a new mindset: the idea that marketing could — and should — become a conveyor belt of sales-ready prospects. This meant adopting a systematic, volume-driven approach. But it was a zero-sum game. The conveyor belt of Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs)didn’t augment what marketing was already doing but instead replaced much of it. Marketing shifted away from developing preference for the brand and its solutions to producing mass quantities of MQLs.",
      "The Rise of the MQL-Industrial Complex What followed was a pivot towards building “factories” dedicated to MQL production:",
      "Consequences of the Industrialized Approach | Decline in Brand Building and Reputation Management The relentless focus on MQL production led to an unintended consequence: traditional brand-building activities and reputation management fell by the wayside. Organizations began to treat MQLs as the primary “product” of marketing, neglecting the underlying strategic value of building a strong, resonant brand that could guide buyer preferences.",
      "Moving Forward: Balancing Automation and Relationship Building | The conversation today should pivot toward blending the efficiency of automated processes with the nuanced, relationship-centric strategies that characterized earlier stages of marketing. Here’s what that balance might look like:",
      "Far from obscuring accountability for marketing, this new AI-enabled approach allows organizations to see clearly how preference and engagement impact downstream revenue production, even when those key outcomes occur months and quarters after the marketing activities that influenced them.",
      "Concluding Thoughts | The industrialization of marketing, driven by technology designed for 1-person buying groups, led to a factory-like approach that prioritized quantity of output and ease of measurement over buyer engagement and the development of real selling opportunities. This model, though efficient in generating BDR cadence-fodder, didn’t align with the reality B2B buyers, their needs, and their behavior while in-market.",
      "Recognizing this gap has set the stage for a new era — one where AI enables marketers to deal effectively with the real-world complexity of B2B buying. In turn, the effectiveness gains that result will enable marketers to return to more strategic, holistic marketing practices that emphasize building trust, reputation, and meaningful buyer relationships.",
      "The shift calls for a balance, where marketing harnesses the power of automation to manage complexity while simultaneously investing in the brand and strategic narratives that drive consistent revenue growth.",
      "The De-Industrialization of B2B Marketing | June 12, 2025 schedule 9 min By Kerry Cunningham",
      "Related Resources | AI Agents: A User’s Guide B2B Advertising Examples: From Tactics to Results ABM Templates: Build Your Strategic Foundation Before You Scale | Erosion of Brand Connection & Preference:Without consistent investment in brand narrative and reputation, organizations risk losing – or never building — an emotional connection with their buyers. This makes long-term revenue creation hard by commoditizing brands and their solutions. Today’s buyers — especially in complex B2B environments — are looking for partners that add value to their businesses, not pitches and gimmicks. They want trusted, credible voices that promise a mutual exchange of value. | Conflating the Buying Cycle & Sales Cycle:When marketing is driven purely by MQL numbers, the buying journey is obscured. In the minds and measurements of B2B revenue teams, the entirety of the buyer’s journey is collapsed into the 30% of it that occurs after buyers engage with sellers. Revenue teams have come to believe that the buying journey began with the successful engagement of an MQL, when in reality that engagement marks the final stage of the buying process, in which buyers are validating choices they have already made. The rich, contextual signals that indicate a buyer’s readiness, influence, or affiliation within a buying group are ignored, leading to missed opportunities, false hope, and endless, desperate cycles of MQL chasing. | Impact on Revenue GenerationUltimately, when marketing departments become too narrowly focused on producing MQLs, they constrain their potential to contribute to a consistently effective revenue generation. Revenue in B2B is less about transactional leads and more about cultivating enduring relationships – including relationship buyers and users of B2B solutions develop with brands. Absent a robust brand with which buyers easily relate, revenue teams are left in a constant state of panic prospecting, continually fighting from behind in trying to fill pipeline gaps.",
      "Leveraging AI to Deal Effectively with the Complexity of B2B BuyingInstead of simply churning out leads, AI can detect, enable, and foster the conversion of complex buying groups over long and non-linear buying cycles. Real-time ICP monitoring paired with pattern recognition to identify and make sense of the complex web of buying group signals that distinguish real buying processes from occasional, random expressions of interest that pass for ‘intent’ data today. | Intelligent Workflows that Drive Preference and Capture Demand.Rather than chasing MQLs, AI can detect in-market buyers and automate the process of delivering the right content and experiences to the right people at the right time to drive preference and nudge buyers along through their journey. Absent automation, the job is simply to complex and labor-intensive to be possible for most organizations. Absent automation, too many opportunities pass to competitors unnoticed or wither on the vine for lack of proper vendor support. With automation, organizations can not only prevent missed deals, but they can also fully automate the process of enabling buying groups to move forward in their journeys. Dealing with this complexity is precisely what AI in marketing is for. | Reinvesting in Brand and Reputation.The automation of routine tasks not only ensures that organizations will not miss relevant buying journeys. It also frees marketers to refocus on what truly matters: building brand presence, preference, and meaningful buyer engagement. This shift ensures that marketing serves a dual purpose — capturing available demand, while also creating the kind of brand equity that gives sales teams a competitive edge in the field. | Integrated Value Metrics.We must reassess what constitutes “value” in marketing. Instead of measuring success solely by MQL output, organizations must incorporate metrics that measure brand perception and buying group engagement. Measuring perception and engagement are just the first step, though. What really matters is understanding how perception and engagement impact the creation and conversion of sales opportunities. We need to be answering questions, such as, When engagement increases in Q1, how does that impact revenue in Q2 and Q3?"

    "p": [
      "Life History Theory 101 | In nature, there are two very different reproductive strategies: evolutionary biologists refer to them fast and slow lifestyles. | Fast-Life Strategy (Rabbit):Generate lots of leads, keep acquisition costs low, automate onboarding, and accept churn as the cost of scale. | Slow-Life Strategy (Elephant):Mature slowly, reproduce rarely, invest deeply in each offspring. In B2B terms: pursue high-fit accounts, invest heavily in pre-sales and onboarding, and build for long-term expansion and retention.",
      "Fast-life animals, like rabbits, sea turtles, and insects, drop their offspring into the world en masse, investing little to nothing in nurturing them, on the gamble that enough will survive to reproduce and perpetuate the species. Sea turtles exemplify the fast-life strategy. Female sea turtles lay their eggs in the sand and depart, hoping that a few of the hundreds of hatchlings they’ve left behind will dodge the predators that feast on them and find their own way back to the sea. Parents-of-the-year they are not.",
      "Slow-life animals, like elephants, whales, and humans, mature slowly, producing few offspring, and investing heavily in protecting and nurturing each one. Their strategy depends on survival and learning. Slow-lifers are generally larger, investing in body size, weapons, and brains to survive in environments where lesser creatures can’t. This allows them to reproduce later in life. Nurturing parents are crucial, as offsprings are precious and few.",
      "This continuum of reproductive and survival strategies is known asLife History Theory. A species’ position on the spectrum between elephant and sea turtle depends on its environment. Volatile environments, high predation, and disease favor fast-life species, while stable environments with fewer threats favor slow ones.",
      "The key is balancing investment in growth and development with the need to reproduce quickly before it is too late.*",
      "Both strategies can work to perpetuate a species, but only when they’re internally consistent and aligned with the environment. If elephant mothers stopped investing in their calves, the species would die out. If rabbit started delaying reproduction until they were a couple years old instead of a couple months, it wouldn’t be long before there were no more rabbits.",
      "B2B Has a Life-History Problem | So, what does any of this have to do with B2B marketing?",
      "Consider the relationship between how marketing identifies customers, and how the sales and customer organizations develop their relationships.",
      "Most B2B organizations would prefer to have slow-life strategies. They want long-term relationships with high-value customers – customers that will get value from their services in exchange for a profitable relationship. They invest in onboarding, customer success, and cross-functional partnerships that span years. In theory, they’re elephants. Or at least cows.",
      "But when it comes to acquiring those customers? Most B2B organizations runfast-life playbooks: high-volume lead generation, MQLs, scaled ad campaigns, and assembly-line handoffs to sales. Like sea turtles, marketing hatches leads by the hundreds, hoping just a few make it through the funnel alive.",
      "That method of identifying buyers can be effective if the ensuing sales motions are quick and require little investment. But that is not the case with most B2B deals.",
      "Consider the typical B2B organization with multi-quarter sales cycles, complex buying",
      "It’s no wonder sales and marketing often feel out of sync.",
      "If fast-life marketing is volume-based demand gen, thenAccount-Based Marketing (ABM)is a true slow-life strategy.",
      "ABM is about careful selection, deep personalization, and shared investment in the buyer journey. It mirrors the elephant’s strategy: fewer targets, longer development, higher long-term returns. ABM prioritizes account fit over lead volume, engagement over clicks, and long-term value over short-term conversion.",
      "The problem? Even companies that claim to “do ABM” often retain the legacy fast-life demand generation practices. They still measure performance with MQLs. They still run the same gated content programs. They still hand off leads rather than buying groups.",
      "ABM with fast-life marketing is like trying to grow elephant calves with sea-turtle parenting practices. It doesn’t work.",
      "Just like in biology, B2B go-to-market strategies must beinternally consistent. If you want long-term relationships, your acquisition model, pricing, onboarding, and customer success all need to align to that goal.",
      "Here’s a snapshot comparison of slow- and fast-life strategies in B2B terms:",
      "Most companies serve multiple segments—so it’s okay to run both playbooks. But each segment must be supported by an internally consistent strategy.",
      "Don’t try to win slow-life customers with fast-life tactics. And don’t build a high-touch program for buyers who just want to self-serve and move on.",
      "What Needs to Change | B2B organizations whose model is primarily to identify the right customers, invest heavily in acquiring and retaining them should do the following:",
      "Be disciplined:It is tempting to revert to fast-life demand generation practices when slow-life methods appear to be flagging or taking too long to develop. Better to improve and perfect the best-fit practices than to abandon them for short-term fixes that are not sustainable.",
      "This approach isn’t about abandoning all fast-life tactics for all of B2B. Some segments call for them. But it is about becoming more intentional in matching strategy to segment—and abandoning the myth that fast-life, volume-based strategies can produce consistent revenue growth in a slow-life scenario.",
      "*Fascinating research on we humans has found that humans have fast- and slow-life strategies, as well. People who are raised in environments where their physical and emotional well-being is regularly threatened tend to adopt faster-life strategies: they tend to mate earlier in life and engage in riskier behaviors. People who grow up in stable, nurturing environments tend to mate later and are less likely to take drugs and engage is risky behaviors.

      "This companion report presents additional findings from our2025 Marketing Measurement Benchmark. Below, we examine how marketing teams track performance, report results, and tie metrics to compensation based on whether they sell software, services, or physical products.",
      "The 600+ B2B marketers who participated in our study represented organizations selling a range of offerings. To better understand how the type of offering shapes marketing measurement, we grouped them into three categories: software, services, and physical goods.",
      "In ourmain report, we found that 8 in 10 B2B organizations reported having an account-based marketing program. There is nostatistically reliabledifference in that adoption rate based on whether a company sells software, services, or physical products.",
      "While ABM adoption is similar across product types, the way teams measure ABM’s impact on revenue varies in meaningful ways. Teams selling software use a broader set of metrics to assess ABM performance — averaging 3.3 metrics, compared to 2.7 for services and 2.5 for physical goods. The difference in the number of metrics tracked between software and both other groups arestatistically reliablewhile the difference between services and physical goods is not.",
      "Marketers of software — like their counterparts in physical goods — rely on Marketing Qualified Accounts as their leading indicator, but they’re more likely to also track metrics tied to progression through the buying journey, including opportunities, pipeline, and closed-won deals from target accounts.",
      "Services organizations tend to balance lead-centric and account-based approaches, tracking MQLs and MQAs at nearly equal rates (47% and 45%, respectively). While they capture some mid- and late-stage metrics like opportunities and pipeline, their use of closed-won deal metrics remains relatively limited — indicating a partial but incomplete shift toward revenue-oriented measurement.",
      "Marketers of physical products show continued reliance on early-stage indicators like MQLs, with relatively limited use of revenue-stage metrics such as pipeline and closed-won deals — suggesting a focus on lead qualification over full-funnel ABM performance.",
      "Outside of ABM programs, we observe similar patterns. Compared to services and physical goods organizations, software marketers arereliablymore likely to track later-stage measures, such as pipeline opportunities and closed-won deals. In contrast, services and physical goods organizations don’t differ meaningfully from one another on most metrics.",
      "Across all product types, marketers report using account engagement and intent signals to indicate revenue impact. However, there are meaningful differences in how frequently specific signals are used — and by whom. Marketers of physical products are reliably more likely than their peers to use website engagement as a signal of revenue impact. Meanwhile, software marketers are less likely to report using advertising reach compared to those selling services or physical goods. Despite visible differences in the use of intent signals, those gaps are notstatistically reliable.",
      "Use of Third-Party Intent Data | Beyond engagement signals captured directly, we also asked whether teams use third-party intent data to identify pipeline opportunities. Among the three groups, software companies are the most likely to track pipeline opportunities that originate from third-party intent — though even here, only two-thirds report doing so. Services and physical goods companies lag behind, and a notable portion of each group either doesn’t use third-party intent or uses it without tying it to pipeline creation. This suggests missed opportunities to connect intent data with downstream revenue outcomes.",
      "Tracking Engagement at the Buying Group Level | Finally, we asked whether organizations track engagement at the buying group level — a signal of growing measurement sophistication. Roughly three-quarters of B2B organizations say they do. While tracking appears slightly more common among software companies (82%) than among services (76%) or physical goods providers (73%), the overall trend suggests broad adoption across product types.",
      "Board Visibility into ABM Metrics | Across all product types, relatively few ABM-related metrics make it to the boardroom — most are shared by fewer than 1 in 5 organizations. Marketing Qualified Accounts (MQAs) from target accounts are the most reported metric, especially among organizations selling physical goods (30%). Still, outcome-oriented measures like pipeline and closed-won deals remain notably underreported across each category, with no single revenue-stage metric crossing the 15% threshold. This suggests that while ABM metrics may be tracked internally, few are elevated to the level where strategic decisions are made.",
      "Board Visibility into Traditional Demand Gen Metrics | Legacy demand generation metrics are also inconsistently shared with the board. Among these, MQLs — both produced and converted — are the most frequently reported, especially among software companies, where over 1 in 5 report MQL conversions. Still, as with ABM, later-stage outcome metrics like pipeline and closed-won deals are shared less often, particularly by services and physical goods organizations.",
      "Overall, the boardroom view still tilts toward top-of-funnel activity, even as marketing strategies evolve. This is unfortunate.",
      "Relatively few account engagement or intent metrics make it into board-level reporting, regardless of product type. While software organizations are slightly more likely to report each type of signal — especially website engagement (25%) and intent detection (19%) — none of the differences between product categories arestatistically reliable. In other words, while the chart suggests software teams may be more likely to elevate engagement metrics, the gap is not large or consistent enough to draw firm conclusions.",
      "Board Visibility into Third-Party Intent Data | Among organizations that track pipeline opportunities sourced from third-party intent, relatively few report this information at the board level — just 14% to 21%.",
      "Board Visibility into Buying Group Engagement | Among organizations that track buying group engagement, only about 1 in 5 report those metrics to the board — with little difference based on what they sell.",
      "Metrics That Influence Variable Compensation | After examining which metrics are shared with the board, we also looked at which are tied to variable compensation — such as bonuses or commissions. This helps clarify how different types of performance are prioritized.",
      "There is nostatistically reliabledifference in the number of ABM-related metrics tied to variable compensation based on whether marketers are selling software, services, or physical products. Across all categories, just one to two metrics on average are linked to variable compensation such as bonuses or commissions.",
      "On average, all groups report tying fewer than one legacy demand generation metric to variable compensation. But there arestatistically reliabledifferences: marketers of physical goods are reliably less likely than those in services to have these metrics tied to pay. Software companies fall in the middle, and do not differ reliably from either group. While the absolute differences are small, they point to meaningful distinctions in how performance is incentivized across product types.",
      "The chart below shows that MQLs — both produced and converted — are the most common legacy metrics tied to compensation across all offering types. However, the emphasis is strongest among services organizations, where nearly a third link MQLs produced to pay. Software and physical goods companies also use MQLs in comp plans, but at lower rates. Revenue-stage metrics like closed-won deals or pipeline are less frequently tied to compensation overall, and particularly uncommon among physical goods companies. This suggests that compensation structures still largely reflect lead-centric thinking, especially outside of software.",
      "Across all product types, just 0 to 1 engagement or intent metrics are tied to variable compensation, on average. There are nostatistically reliabledifferences based on whether companies sell software, services, or physical goods.",
      "Across product types, most organizations use both sourced and influenced attribution models  —despite the limitations of each.More than half of software (59%) and services (53%) companies apply both. Physical goods marketers are slightly less likely to use both (47%) and more likely to rely on sourced attribution alone.",
      "How Teams Assign Credit | Multi-touch attribution remains the go-to model across product types used by the majority of software, services, and physical goods companies alike. But as we’ve noted in prior reports, multi-touch attribution typically credits just a handful of visible interactions, failing to capture the full complexity of modern buying behavior. Meanwhile, more accurate statistical models are the least used, reinforcing the idea that most attribution is still about convenience, not accuracy.",
      "While marketers across product types use a mix of methods to measure marketing influence, there are a fewstatistically reliabledifferences worth noting. Teams selling physical goods are reliably more likely than their peers to assess influence at the program level. Software marketers, on the other hand, tend to report higher use of overall contribution metrics than services organizations. Beyond those differences, no single level emerges as the clear standard  — or the most trusted indicator of marketing’s impact.",
      "ROI | Regardless of what they sell, nearly all marketers say they measure ROI. Across software, services, and physical goods providers, the rates are consistently high — ranging from 96% to 100%. This signals broad agreement that demonstrating return on marketing investment remains a universal expectation.",
      "The chart below shows that most organizations — regardless of what they sell — rely on overall marketing contribution when measuring ROI. About two-thirds of software and services companies use this approach, compared to nearly three-quarters of physical goods organizations. While all three groups report similar rates of program- and tactic-level ROI measurement, only the differences at the program level arestatistically reliable: physical goods organizations are less likely to measure ROI by program than their software and services peers.",
      "Mapping Relationship Journeys: Funnel and Waterfall Models | Waterfall models offer a structured way to map the relationship between buyers and sellers over time. They help organizations track how accounts move through defined stages of engagement and opportunity creation. Some models begin with initial sales interactions, while others take a broader view — starting from the moment an account is identified or targeted, well before direct engagement from sales. In either case, the goal is to bring consistency and visibility to the stages leading up to, and including, opportunity development.",
      "Opportunity-based and account-based models are the most widely used, each reported by roughly half of respondents. Lead-based models remain common as well, especially among physical goods companies. While sales-only models are the least used overall, they’re reliably more common among physical goods organizations — astatistically reliabledifference from both software and services companies.",

      "Respondent and Company Profiles | We surveyed 634 B2B marketers in the early months of 2025. Responses were collected through a third-party panel provider. To address underrepresentation of VC-backed companies, the final dataset also includes 100 synthetic responses generated using predictive modeling based on patterns from real VC-backed respondents. This is described in more detail below.",
      "Where appropriate, we compare this year’s results with responses collected in previous years — 716 additional responses gathered across 2023 and 2024 — to identify patterns over time.",
      "Industries Represented | Respondents were most likely to work in Services organizations (57%), followed by Technology companies (18%) and Manufacturing firms (12%). The remaining 14% fell into an “Other” category for which respondents provided their own industry descriptions.",
      "Seniority and Role Scope | A plurality of respondents held manager-level roles (35%), with directors making up another 23%. C-level leaders represented 18% of the sample, while 15% were individual contributors and 9% were VPs.",

      "Expanded Sample for VC-Backed Organizations | To address the limited representation of marketers from VC-backed organizations, we included 100 synthetic responses from simulated VC-backed organizations. These responses were generated using predictive modeling based on patterns observed in our real VC-backed respondents. Statistical tests confirm that there are no meaningful differences between the real and synthetic responses, indicating that the simulated data provides an accurate reflection of how additional VC-backed organizations would be expected to respond. Including these responses enhances the overall balance and representativeness of the sample — ensuring VC-backed companies are proportionally reflected in the findings.",
      "Company Size | Respondents came from organizations of all sizes. The largest group (44%) worked at small companies with 200 or fewer employees, where average revenue was under $1 million. Mid-sized companies (201 to 1,000 employees) made up 27% of the sample, with revenue ranging from just under $1 million to around $30 million.",

There is no statistically reliable difference in that adoption rate based on whether a company sells software, services, or physical products.",
      "Measurement Practices in Traditional Demand Gen | Outside of ABM programs, we observe similar patterns. Compared to services and physical goods organizations, software marketers are reliably more likely to track later-stage measures, such as pipeline opportunities and closed-won deals. In contrast, services and physical goods organizations don’t differ meaningfully from one another on most metrics.",
      "Account Engagement and Intent Metrics | Across all product types, marketers report using account engagement and intent signals to indicate revenue impact. However, there are meaningful differences in how frequently specific signals are used — and by whom. Marketers of physical products are reliably more likely than their peers to use website engagement as a signal of revenue impact. Meanwhile, software marketers are less likely to report using advertising reach compared to those selling services or physical goods. Despite visible differences in the use of intent signals, those gaps are not statistically reliable .",
      "Which Engagement Metrics Reach the Board | Relatively few account engagement or intent metrics make it into board-level reporting, regardless of product type. While software organizations are slightly more likely to report each type of signal — especially website engagement (25%) and intent detection (19%) — none of the differences between product categories are statistically reliable . In other words, while the chart suggests software teams may be more likely to elevate engagement metrics, the gap is not large or consistent enough to draw firm conclusions.",
      "ABM Metrics in Compensation Plans | There is no statistically reliable difference in the number of ABM-related metrics tied to variable compensation based on whether marketers are selling software, services, or physical products. Across all categories, just one to two metrics on average are linked to variable compensation such as bonuses or commissions.",
      "Legacy Demand Gen Metrics in Compensation Plans | On average, all groups report tying fewer than one legacy demand generation metric to variable compensation. But there are statistically reliable differences: marketers of physical goods are reliably less likely than those in services to have these metrics tied to pay. Software companies fall in the middle, and do not differ reliably from either group. While the absolute differences are small, they point to meaningful distinctions in how performance is incentivized across product types.",
      "Account Engagement & Intent Signals That Influence Pay | Across all product types, just 0 to 1 engagement or intent metrics are tied to variable compensation, on average. There are no statistically reliable differences based on whether companies sell software, services, or physical goods.",
      "Attribution | Across product types, most organizations use both sourced and influenced attribution models  — despite the limitations of each. More than half of software (59%) and services (53%) companies apply both. Physical goods marketers are slightly less likely to use both (47%) and more likely to rely on sourced attribution alone.",
      "How Marketers Attribute Influence | While marketers across product types use a mix of methods to measure marketing influence, there are a few statistically reliable differences worth noting. Teams selling physical goods are reliably more likely than their peers to assess influence at the program level. Software marketers, on the other hand, tend to report higher use of overall contribution metrics than services organizations. Beyond those differences, no single level emerges as the clear standard  — or the most trusted indicator of marketing’s impact.",

    "meta_description": "This report examines how modern B2B marketing strategies like ABM are still constrained by outdated lead-based metrics.",
    "p": [
      "Introduction | In 1975, Kodak built the world’s first digital camera. But their current revenue depended on film sales. Rather than threaten that model, they shelved the innovation — and missed the future.",
      "Most B2B marketing teams find themselves in a similar position today.",
      "For over a decade, we’ve optimized marketing for efficiency and volume of MQLs produced — tracking MQLs, lead scores, and conversion rates like gospel. We built lead factories and still measure them using assembly-line KPIs. We think of this as the industrialization of B2B marketing.",
      "Data from ourbuyer experience researchclearly show that buyers have opted out of this industrialized approach. They are reluctant to complete our forms, remain anonymous as long as possible, and rarely respond when our BDRs attempt to to reach them. The industrialize, MQL factory approach to B2B has alienated the very buyers we are trying to attract and engage.",
      "We know from the research that buyers have opted out of being funnel fodder. Instead, they build short lists and vet options on their own and only engage with vendors who’ve earned it.",
      "We also know that a person who fills out a form isn’t necessarily in-market — or that you’re being considered. Conversely, buying groups that have not become leads for you may very well be evaluating you against your competitors.Marketing’s job isn’t to hand off dead-end leads. It is to earn early inclusion in short lists and build preference with buying groups — well before Sales gets involved.",
      "To find out, we surveyed over 600 B2B marketers across industries, company sizes, and go-to-market strategies. We examined ABM and demand gen teams, attribution models, compensation plans, and board-level reporting.",
      "Marketing strategy may be evolving, but measurement remains stuck in the past.",
      "Across nearly every finding, the same pattern emerges: modern approaches like ABM are being layered on top of lead-centric infrastructure. Teams say they’ve moved on from MQLs, but MQLs still drive reporting, compensation, and perceived performance.",
      "If marketing wants to claim strategic relevance, it has to measure like it. That means moving beyond sourced/influenced labels, dropping vanity metrics, and aligning KPIs to how buying actually works.",
      "Otherwise, like Kodak, we risk perfecting the wrong model—until it is too late to pivot.",
      "Nearly80% of organizationsreport having an ABM program, but most describe theirs as only somewhat developed.",
      "MQLs remain thedominant metricin both ABM and demand gen efforts, while revenue-focused outcomes — like closed-won deals or influenced pipeline – are tracked far less consistently.",
      "Multi-touch modelsdominate but rely on narrow, visible interactions. More diagnostic methods – like statistical modeling – are underused, leaving blind spots in evaluating true impact.",
      "Organizations with ABM are more likely to incorporatepre-sales engagement and use opportunity- or account-based models. In contrast, legacy teams often rely on lead-based or sales-owned frameworks.",
      "A decade ago, SiriusDecisions found that 20% of B2B organizations had an ABM program in place. Today, that number has grown to 80%. On the surface, that seems to signal a near-universal move away from leads and toward buying groups and accounts. But widespread adoption doesn’t guarantee depth or consistency in execution.",
      "While there are undoubtedly organizations that have built mature and successful ABM programs, much of the data in this report suggests that many ABMers are still being measured against traditional lead-based KPIs. In other words, simply having an ABM program does not indicate that a marketing organization has matured to address how buying really works. A substantial share of teams are either in transition or have stalled in their efforts.",
      "We have also discovered that there is also a smaller segment of marketers whose responses reflect more aspiration than reality—socially desirable responders. These individuals, prone to a well-documented survey bias, tend to answer in ways they believe will be viewed favorably. In this case, that meant being more likely to say they have an ABM program, and far more likely to report strong financial performance. In other words,the 80% ABM adoption rate we found is padded by a small but meaningful group of “Inflators” whose answers likely reflect intent or ambition more than actual practice.",
      "To get a better read on how teams perceive their own maturity, we drew on findings from a separate study conducted withSloane Staffing, where nearly 200 B2B practitioners in ABM or ABX roles were asked to assess the state of their programs:",
      "Budget allocation offers yet another indicator of maturity. Those just getting started or “somewhat developed” devote an average of 26% of their marketing budgets to ABM. That rises to 34% among “well-established” programs and jumps to 66% among the small group that describe themselves as fully scaled.",
      "While that final group is small and should be interpreted with caution, the broader pattern suggests that mature programs require a greater resource commitment.",
      "It is clear that most organizations are not yet willing to make that commitment.",
      "Together, these gaps — in self-assessment, budget allocation, and continued reliance on lead-based KPIs — suggest that ABM, while widely adopted in name, is not as deeply embedded in practice.",
      "The sections that follow examine where momentum toward modern marketing runs headfirst into systems still designed to measure MQL factories.",
      "Nearly half of ABM adopters still measure success by MQLs, even from non-target accounts. That is not strategic alignment; it is legacy habit. True post-industrial ABM should prioritize progress through the buying journey and business outcomes—not arbitrary qualification thresholds. Yet only a third track pipeline from target accounts, and even fewer measure revenue impact.",
      "Until we shed MQL-era thinking and retool around intent and influence, we’re just putting new labels on decrepit machines.",
      "What Gets Reported Up: Progress Measured in the Wrong Currency | If you want to know what a company values, look at what gets reported to up the management chain.",
      "In B2B marketing, there’s finally some movement:more than a third (39%) of ABM programs report MQAs to the board.That is notable. MQAs are, at least in theory, more aligned with account-based strategies than MQLs ever were.",
      "Marketing is not reporting outcome metrics. But, we can be certain that sales is. In other words, outcome metrics—pipeline and revenue—remain the domain of sales. As long as these outcome metrics remain “sales-only” territory, marketing remains the junior partner in revenue production.",
      "Company Size and What Gets Reported Up | In small companies, board members tend to see everything—often the same reports as senior leadership.",
      "The larger and more complex the company, the thinner the marketing story that is told at the top. This is to be expected when organizations are operating established processes. However, as we have seen, most organizations are still in transition – in limbo between the old industrial, lead-focused way of working and the more modern account- and buying-group centric models.",
      "That 40% of marketers have MQAs tied to the variable compensation is a great step forward. However, there is a substantial drop-off when it comes to opportunities and pipeline – more revenue-adjacent metrics.",
      "That is the headline from three years of data. Despite near-universal adoption of attribution models—92% of ABM teams and 68% of legacy teams say they use one—the foundation underneath is still shaky. The models in use may be more complex than in the past, but complexity isn’t the same as insight.",
      "Both rely on an optimistic assumption: that we can identify a meaningful starting point or moment of influence in buying journeys that are anonymous, messy, and fragmented.",
      "That may sound like progress. Adoption is up substantially from several years ago. It is not, however, progress.",
      "Multi-touch usually means crediting three or four visible interactions. That is still a rounding error on the actual number of interactions buying groups have with vendors. A typical buying group of 11 people generate150–200 digital touchpoints per vendor. Multi-touch isn’t measuring influence. It is cherry-picking.",
      "Just20% of ABM programsand18% of legacy teamsusestatistical attribution— the only model that can account for the full pattern of interactions over time. That is because it is harder to implement and harder to explain. But it is the only approach grounded in actual impact.",
      "Until statistical attribution becomes the default, attribution will remain what it is today: a story we tell ourselves to justify the intuition- and preference-based decision-making.",
      "Sourced vs. Influenced: Attribution’s Mirror Images | If sourcing is about origin stories for deals, influence is about plot twists. And, both are flawed—but in different ways.",
      "Neither model can reliably track what caused a buying group to act—only that marketing was visible somewhere along the way.The logic assumes cause where there’s often only coincidence.",
      "We know fromresearch on how buyers buythat most buyers enter a journey with prior experience with brands. And we know that only 3 in 10 buying group members of a buying group that will buy from you will fill in a form. Most of those evaluating you will stay anonymous.There’s no evidence that the person or the moment who first fills out a form is special or decisive in any way.",
      "The origin of the opportunity – why you got on the list at all – is almost certainly not the first time you saw a form fill.",
      "So Why Use It? | When deals are transactional in nature (<30 day buying cycle), deal sourcing can be a more reasonable approximation of what matters. Otherwise, ‘sourced’ metrics are closer to disinformation than information.",
      "That sounds comprehensive, but these percentages are nearly identical between ABM and non-ABM teams. ABM hasn’t changed influence measurement — it is just rebranded the same habits.",
      "Influence Metrics Are a Vibe, Not a Verdict | Most influence measures are not much better. Theoretically, all measures should be influence, rather than sourced measures, for reasons stated above. Asking, “What actions tended to increase the likelihood of buyers choosing us?” is a very good question to ask. The data exist to answer the question.",
      "However, as practiced in the real world still, they typically account for a small fraction of marketing touches, and they are not calculating how actions increased or decreased conversion, but instead are apportioning revenue or pipeline amounts simply based on a tactic having been ‘touched’ by a buying group. In most cases, this will be a record of what the marketing organization just happened to be doing at the time a buyer was engaging, not a record of what actually works or does not to increase buyer preference.",
      "Marketing is involved in most opportunities. But saying a tactictoucheda deal doesn’t mean it influenced it meaningfully.Until we distinguish between proximity and causality, influence reporting will remain an exercise in confirmation bias.",
      "Measuring marketing ROI is a near-universal practice — especially among ABM teams.Ninety-seven percent of organizations running ABM programs report that they measure marketing return on investment, compared to 89% of legacy teams. Given ABM’s focus on high-value accounts and often larger investments per deal, the pressure to prove impact may be driving more consistent ROI tracking.",
      "Sixty-three percent of respondents — ABM and legacy alike — report measuring marketing ROI based on overall contribution, rather than isolating the impact of specific programs or tactics. Program-level evaluation is slightly less common (46% for ABM teams, 39% for legacy). Fortunately, fewer teams assess ROI at the tactic level.Tactic-level ROI measurements undervalue tactics aimed at early-journey buyers and so tend mislead rather than inform.",
      "These patterns suggest that most organizations prioritize a holistic view of marketing’s impact — one that may be more practical or accessible with their current tools and data structures.",
      "The fact that opportunity-based models are now the most common among organizations with ABM programs is perhaps the clearest sign of progress we encountered.Opportunities are the fundamental unit of measure in B2B, and waterfall or funnel models that are built to track progress against opportunities are the most reality-aligned methods for gauging success.",
      "How Marketers See Their Own Measurement Systems | Throughout this report, we’ve noted signs of progress — but also plenty of reminders that measurement practices still operate in the shadow of legacy models, and compensation structures do little to reinforce the behaviors modern marketing demands. Given these gaps, we asked participants to tell us whether they thought their measurement practices were a fair measure of marketing’s contribution.",
      "The average response fell between “neutral” and “somewhat fair.” That middling sentiment serves as a fitting reflection of the broader patterns we’ve seen throughout this report.",
      "Surprisingly, there were no differences in how marketers felt about their measurement systems based on the programs they run — ABM or not. One might expect those leaning into more modern, account-based approaches to feel especially misaligned. Instead, there appears to be a universal, mild sense of disconnect.",
      "Implications | For most B2B purchases, the buyer is — and has always been — a group of individuals working together to solve a business problem. Marketing’s shift toward account-based approaches and buying group recognition increasingly reflects that reality — 8 in 10 organizations say they have an ABM program in place.",
      "But, as discussed above, modern approaches have been broadly adopted, but more often that not remain niche practices within B2B organizations.",
      "We contend that a substantial reason more modern practices have not come to occupy more central role in B2B is that legacy measurement practices that remain prevalent do not capture the value modern strategies provide.",
      "As we have seen, only 29% of ABM teams are measured solely through ABM-aligned metrics. The rest continue to rely on a combination of ABM and legacy measures, legacy measures alone — or, in some cases, no measurement at all.",
      "The industrial, lead-factory model continues to shape reporting, incentives, and strategy. MQLs still dominate dashboards. Attribution frameworks — sourced, influenced, first-touch, last-touch — persist, despite their untenable foundations.",
      "This misalignment is especially problematic given that most buyers (84%) have already selected their preferred vendor before contacting sellers which happens over two-thirds of the way through their buying journey. By the time sales gets involved, the shortlist has often been formed—and if marketing hasn’t influenced the buying group early in the journey, it’s likely too late. Yet the metrics used to assess performance remain anchored to the handoff: MQAs and MQLs.",
      "If marketing’s influence during the earlier — and more decisive — stages is left out of the reporting picture, leadership will assume it isn’t there.",
      "This gap between how B2B buying happens and how marketing is measured is precisely why we introduced theThree Principles of Modern Marketingin last year’s report. They remain just as relevant — and just as necessary — today.",
      "Each principle points to what modern marketing teams should be doing—and measuring. We strongly encourage readers to explore the three principles further and examine current measurement practices for opportunities to align measurement to the reality of modern B2B.",

    "meta_description": "B2B teams are still fighting a lead-gen war that’s already over. This piece unpacks the MQL-Industrial Complex—and how to finally move beyond it.",
    "p": [
      "In 1974, Japanese soldier Hiroo Onoda emerged from the Philippine jungle, nearly 30 years after World War II had ended. He had refused to believe the war was over, dismissing the leaflets and news broadcasts announcing Japan’s surrender as enemy propaganda. | Terrible lead-conversion rates– ~1% lead to revenue | Forms avoidance– ~20% of visitors from identifiable accounts fill in a form | Pitch avoidance –If they don’t know you already, buyers won’t talk to you until they’ve picked a consensus winner more than two-thirds through their journeys",
      "Onoda wasn’t mentally incapacitated when he emerged from the jungle. In fact, he was able to integrate into society (although disillusioned by the Japan he returned to), marry, and live a long life (40 more years) after emerging from the jungle.  There had been nothing wrong with him that kept him fighting a war that had long-since ended. He was operating from within a paradigm established by a deeply ingrained training program that had once served him well.",
      "The world had changed. The battlefield was gone. The mission was no longer relevant. But he had identified so completely with that mission, that he did not accept any of the rather obvious signs that it was over.",
      "If you’ve worked in B2B marketing or sales for any length of time, you have been deeply embedded in what I call the MQL-Industrial Complex (MIC) – the web or processes, tools, measurements, and mental models that make production and conversion of MQLs the central mission of B2B marketing teams.",
      "Chances are good that much of the way your ‘demand gen’ or ‘demand creation’ teams operate today is firmly entrenched in the MIC. You’re stuck with old goals and measurements against which we can never make consistent progress.",
      "That’s because you are fighting a war that’s long since ended – not because you’re stubborn or unaware. Rather, there’s a vast ecosystem – the MQL-Industrial Complex, which was built to keep you there.",
      "The Old Tactics: The MQL-Industrial Complex | Much of modern B2B marketing is built on the idea of generating leads — capturing contact information through gated content, scoring those leads based on what are, in essence, random behaviors, and routing them to BDR/SDRs for follow-up.",
      "This approach seemed to make sense. But we know now that it doesn’t. The principal reason they don’t make sense is thatmost B2B buying is done by groups (average = 11 members). The behavior of one individual simply doesn’t represent a group most of the time.",
      "Not only that, but buyers say very clearly that they do not respond to your BDRs (just as you don’t, btw). Most of the people who do fill in forms are not currently in market. If they are, they are early in the process and do not want to be pitched. They file those emails away and when/if they become ready, they get in touch.",
      "It has been that way for years – probably more than a decade. Our collective lead conversion rates have been atrocious for at least that long. But that approach became codified and deeply embedded in processes, dashboards, automation tools, and team structures.",
      "Lead gen, rather than buyer enablement became the mission. The MQL became the unit of success.",
      "And the “demand generation” that was really justcapturingdemand that already existed was mistaken for  activity that was causing demand.",
      "Buyers Long Ago Left the Jungle | Today’s buyers don’t need to be captured. They need to be enabled. They’re doing their own research, relying on peers, third-party sites, and trusted sources well before they ever raise a hand. At 6sense, our research has shown that buying journeys are already 70% complete before a buyer reaches out to engage with sellers, and that they’ve established a consensus favorite vendor by that time.",
      "They visit your site. They compare reviews on G2 and TrustRadius, read content on TechTarget. They join Slack communities and LinkedIn groups. They may even read your whitepaper – but not via a form fill. And they do most of that anonymously.",
      "By the time they show up in your CRM, the are not in a sales process with you, you are in their process of validating a choice they’ve already made.",
      "The Evidence of Disconnect | Despite this shift, many revenue teams still cling to lead gen as the core strategy. The symptoms of the disconnect are everywhere:",
      "The message is clear: buyers want to be left alone until they’re ready — and when they are, they want help, not a sales cadence.",
      "Why We’re Still Fighting: The MQL-Industrial Complex | So why are so many revenue teams still in the jungle, running campaigns and cadences designed for a world that no longer exists?",
      "Escaping the MIC Jungle: What It Takes | The way out isn’t just to criticize the old model – it’s to replace it with something better.",
      "That starts with abandoning lead gen as the central objective and shifting toward buying group centric practices and a focus on buyer enablement. In practice, this means:",
      "This isn’t easy. Escaping the jungle requires courage… and time. But staying in it is far worse.",
      "A New Kind of Loyalty | Hiroo Onoda was loyal – to his command, his training, and his country. But his loyalty kept him fighting a war that no longer existed.",
      "In B2B marketing, we need a new kind of loyalty. Not to the MQL-Industrial Complex. Not to vanity metrics. But to processes and practices that are aligned to our buyers – to their needs as buyers, and– to creating actual pipeline, to making buying easier, to driving meaningful growth.",
      "But the battle for buyers is still on. The teams that thrive will be those who stop trying to rack up leads, and instead focus on identifying and enabling buyers.",

      "Prioritizing buying groups: The primary difference between the old and the new is the shift from leads to buying groups. | Understand the buyer’s journey: The buying journey and the sales funnel are two entirely different things. Realizing that sales processes are just one-third of the buying process on average is key to understanding buyers. | Creating real value upfront: Make content accessible. Eliminate the friction. Help buyers solve problems before they become customers. | Rethinking measurement: Move away from lead counts and toward metrics that recognize buying group | Investing in Brand Gravity: Buyers put 4 of the 5 vendors they will evaluate on the short list on day one of their journeys. So, we need our brands to attract and continually engage the buyers we want to sell to prior to when they do into market."

    "meta_description": "This companion to the 2025 Marketing Measurement Benchmark explores how average selling price (ASP) shapes B2B marketing measurement—highlighting differences in ABM adoption, metric tracking, and board reporting across deal sizes.",
    "p": [
      "This companion report presents additional findings from our2025 Marketing Measurement Benchmark— breaking down how marketing teams track performance, report results, and tie metrics to compensation based on the average selling price (ASP) of their offerings.",
      "To understand how deal size influences marketing measurement, we grouped responses into ASP bands — ranging from lower-cost, high-volume solutions to high-value, enterprise purchases — and compared how teams adapt their strategies and metrics across that continuum.",
      "In ourmain report, we found that 8 in 10 B2B organizations reported having an account-based marketing program. Organizations selling lower-cost offerings (annualized value between $10K and $100K) are statistically less likely to report having an ABM program. Still, nearly two-thirds (63%) of companies in this segment say they do — underscoring how widespread ABM has become, even for lower-priced solutions. Among companies selling solutions priced above $250K annually, reported ABM adoption reaches over 90%.",
      "Not only does ABM adoption vary across deal sizes, but the way teams measure ABM’s impact on revenue does too.",
      "Organizations selling lower-cost offerings ($10K to $100K) are less likely to track advanced ABM metrics like opportunities, pipeline, or closed-won deals from target accounts. These teams tend to focus on earlier-stage indicators such as MQLs, tracking an average of just under 2.4 ABM-related metrics.",
      "Teams selling mid- to higher-priced offerings ($250K to $750K) arereliablymore likely to track full-funnel metrics tied to account progression — reporting over 3.8 metrics on average. They appear to have a stronger handle on ABM measurement, with increased reporting of opportunities, pipeline, and even closed-won deals from target accounts.Still, in the broader context of ABM maturity, these figures remain modest. Even among organizations with higher ASPs, advanced measurement practices are far from universal suggesting that many are still only partially connecting ABM efforts to revenue outcomes.",
      "Across all deal sizes, non-ABM demand generation metrics continue to be widely tracked. But there are meaningful differences in how consistently they’re used. Organizations with higher deal sizes (especially $250K to $750K) arereliablymore likely to track the full-funnel: they report higher usage of converted MQLs, pipeline, and early-stage opportunities. By contrast, teams with smaller ASPs (<$250K) tend to concentrate more on MQLs produced and converted only.",
      "Account Engagement and Intent Metrics | Most B2B marketing teams track similar types of engagement and intent signals, regardless of the price point of the solutions they sell. Accounts engaging with website content are the most commonly tracked signal across all deal sizes, and teams selling mid- to high-priced offerings ($250K to $750K) are statistically more likely to track this signal than those selling lower-cost solutions. Intent signals and advertising reach, while also monitored, show less consistent differences across deal sizes. In general, the types of engagement metrics being tracked are fairly consistent—but some signals, like web engagement, appear to gain more traction among mid-market teams.",
      "Use of Third-Party Intent Data | In addition to the engagement and intent signals above, we also asked whether teams use third-party intent data to identify pipeline opportunities. Most do.",
      "Tracking Engagement at the Buying Group Level | We also asked whether organizations track engagement at the buying group level. Roughly three-quarters of B2B organizations say they do. While tracking appears somewhat more common among those selling mid-to-large deals—especially in the $500K to $750K range—this practice is reported across all ASP bands. The overall trend suggests widespread adoption, regardless of deal size.",
      "Board Visibility into ABM Metrics | Across all deal sizes, B2B marketers report relatively few ABM-related metrics to the board—often zero or just one. But reporting becomes more common as deal size increases.",
      "On average, organizations selling lower-cost offerings (under $250K) report fewer than one ABM metric to the board. Meanwhile, those selling mid-to-large deals ($500K–$750K) arereliablymore likely to report at least one metric tied to ABM performance. When ABM metrics are shared with the board, the most common ones tend to be early indicators. Marketing Qualified Accounts and Opportunities from target accounts top the list — especially among organizations with deal sizes over $500K, where about 1 in 4 report these metrics to executive leadership. More advanced metrics like pipeline and closed-won revenue from ABM accounts are reported less frequently, even among higher-ASP teams.",
      "Board Visibility into Traditional Demand Gen Metrics | When it comes to non-ABM demand generation, reporting to the board remains relatively limited across all deal sizes. MQL metrics — both volume and conversion — are again the most commonly surfaced, especially among teams selling $500K to $750K solutions. But even in that range, fewer than 30% report MQL conversion at the board level. Metrics tied to deeper funnel outcomes — like pipeline or closed-won deals — are rarely included in board-facing reports.",
      "When it comes to the engagement and intent signals that make it into board-level reporting, most B2B organizations share similar types of metrics. Account-level intent and website engagement are more commonly reported than advertising reach, but this general pattern doesn’t reliably differ by deal size. While some differences appear in the raw percentages, high variability in responses means there are nostatistically reliabledifferences in which types of signals are prioritized in board conversations across ASP bands.",
      "Board Visibility into Third-Party Intent Data | Among organizations that track pipeline opportunities sourced from third-party intent, relatively few report this information at the board level—just 13% to 27%.",
      "Board Visibility into Buying Group Engagement | Among organizations that track engagement at the buying group level, relatively few report these metrics to the board. Across deal sizes, reporting rates remain modest—generally under 30%. While organizations selling larger deals are somewhat more likely to elevate this data to leadership, the overall picture suggests limited board-level visibility into buying group engagement.",
      "The number of ABM metrics tied to variable compensation remains low overall. Across organizations selling lower- to mid-priced solutions (under $250K), fewer than one metric on average is linked to pay. While teams selling $500K–$750K solutions reportreliablymore compensation-linked metrics (over 2 on average), these teams are the exception. Even among high-value deal sizes, the number of ABM metrics tied to comp rarely exceeds one or two, suggesting that most organizations still separate performance measurement from incentive structures.Marketing Qualified Accounts (MQAs) stand out as the most commonly tied to compensation — especially among organizations selling mid- to high-value offerings. Opportunities and pipeline from target accounts also appear more frequently, particularly in the $500K to $750K range. But across all deal sizes, it’s rare for more advanced ABM metrics (like closed-won deals from target accounts) to be directly tied to pay.",
      "Legacy Demand Gen Metrics in Compensation Plans | Just like with ABM, organizations selling higher-priced offerings are more likely to tie their non-ABM demand generation metrics to compensation. But again, the actual number of metrics tied to comp is low overall.",
      "Teams selling lower-cost solutions (under $250K) report tying fewer than one non-ABM metric to compensation, on average. In contrast, teams in the $500K to $750K range stand out, with significantly higher averages—closer to 1.6 metrics. This group is reliably different from all others in the post hoc test.",
      "Still, even at the higher end, we’re not seeing many metrics tied to variable pay—suggesting that while alignment between performance and incentives improves with deal size, it’s far from universal.Across deal sizes, MQL-related metrics are the most likely to be tied to compensation. MQLs produced and MQLs converted appear more frequently than other metrics in variable comp structures—particularly among teams selling mid- to high-value offerings.",
      "Across most deal sizes, B2B organizations report tying none or just one engagement or intent metric to compensation, on average. However, teams selling mid-to-large deals in the $500K–$750K range are statistically more likely to incentivize at least one such metric. By comparison, teams selling lower-cost offerings ($100K to $500K) are reliably less likely to link these signals to pay.When it comes towhichmetrics are being incentivized, website engagement appears more commonly tied to compensation among teams selling mid- to higher-priced offerings ($250K to $750K). However, these differences are notstatistically reliable. In other words, while higher-ASP organizations mayappearmore likely to use these signals in comp plans, the variation within deal size bands is too high to say for certain.",
      "Attribution | Across deal sizes, most organizations report using both marketing-sourced and influenced attribution models. The proportion ranges from 56% to 61% across ASP bands, with no major deviations.",
      "How Teams Assign Credit | Multi-touch remains the dominant attribution model across deal sizes. But, as noted in past research, multi-touch typically assigns credit to just a few visible interactions, offering an incomplete and likely deceptive view of the full buyer journey.",
      "Despite its limitations, multi-touch far outpaces more rigorous approaches. Statistical modeling—the only method capable of estimating actual impact across all activities—is the least used. Fewer than 1 in 4 teams apply it, even among those selling high-value offerings. This pattern reinforces a familiar theme: attribution remains more about what’s easy to track than what’s actually driving outcomes.",
      "How Marketers Attribute Influence | Marketers use a variety of methods to measure influence, but most focus on either program-level or tactic-level reporting. Teams selling mid-range solutions ($250K to $500K) are reliably more likely to measure influence at the tactic level compared to several other ASP groups. This suggests a stronger focus on tactic attribution among these teams.",
      "In contrast, teams with lower-cost offerings ($100K to $250K) are reliably less likely to measure influence at the program level, indicating a more limited approach to assessing marketing’s broader contribution. In contrast, while the chart suggests differences in overall-level influence measurement by ASP category, high variation in responses prevented detection of anystatistically reliabledifferences across ASP groups for this type of measurement.",
      "Marketing ROI measurement is nearly universal.Regardless of deal size, the vast majority of B2B organizations report tracking marketing return on investment—suggesting that ROI measurement is now a baseline expectation.",
      "Overall contribution is the most commonly used approach across all deal sizes. Teams selling $500K to $750K offerings arereliablymore likely than several other ASP groups to measure ROI at the tactic level. This suggests a stronger emphasis on tracking individual campaign performance among this segment—potentially reflecting the need to justify higher-cost initiatives with more granular evidence of return.",
      "Waterfall models offer a structured way to map the relationship between buyers and sellers over time. They help organizations track how accounts move through defined stages of engagement and opportunity creation. Some models begin with initial sales interactions, while others take a broader view — starting from the moment an account is identified or targeted, well before direct engagement from sales. In either case, the goal is to bring consistency and visibility to the stages leading up to, and including, deal conversion. Teams selling $500K to $750K solutions are the most likely to useopportunity-basedwaterfall models—suggesting a focus on buying-stage progression. But they also top the list forlead-basedmodels, highlighting how legacy and modern practices often coexist.",

Organizations with higher deal sizes (especially $250K to $750K) are reliably more likely to track the full-funnel: they report higher usage of converted MQLs, pipeline, and early-stage opportunities. By contrast, teams with smaller ASPs (<$250K) tend to concentrate more on MQLs produced and converted only.",
      "Which Engagement Metrics Reach the Board | When it comes to the engagement and intent signals that make it into board-level reporting, most B2B organizations share similar types of metrics. Account-level intent and website engagement are more commonly reported than advertising reach, but this general pattern doesn’t reliably differ by deal size. While some differences appear in the raw percentages, high variability in responses means there are no statistically reliable differences in which types of signals are prioritized in board conversations across ASP bands.",
      "ABM Metrics in Compensation Plans | The number of ABM metrics tied to variable compensation remains low overall. Across organizations selling lower- to mid-priced solutions (under $250K), fewer than one metric on average is linked to pay. While teams selling $500K–$750K solutions report reliably more compensation-linked metrics (over 2 on average), these teams are the exception. Even among high-value deal sizes, the number of ABM metrics tied to comp rarely exceeds one or two, suggesting that most organizations still separate performance measurement from incentive structures.Marketing Qualified Accounts (MQAs) stand out as the most commonly tied to compensation — especially among organizations selling mid- to high-value offerings. Opportunities and pipeline from target accounts also appear more frequently, particularly in the $500K to $750K range. But across all deal sizes, it’s rare for more advanced ABM metrics (like closed-won deals from target accounts) to be directly tied to pay.",
      "Account Engagement & Intent Signals That Influence Pay | Across most deal sizes, B2B organizations report tying none or just one engagement or intent metric to compensation, on average. However, teams selling mid-to-large deals in the $500K–$750K range are statistically more likely to incentivize at least one such metric. By comparison, teams selling lower-cost offerings ($100K to $500K) are reliably less likely to link these signals to pay.When it comes to which metrics are being incentivized, website engagement appears more commonly tied to compensation among teams selling mid- to higher-priced offerings ($250K to $750K). However, these differences are not statistically reliable . In other words, while higher-ASP organizations may appear more likely to use these signals in comp plans, the variation within deal size bands is too high to say for certain.",
      "ROI | Marketing ROI measurement is nearly universal. Regardless of deal size, the vast majority of B2B organizations report tracking marketing return on investment—suggesting that ROI measurement is now a baseline expectation.",
      "Mapping Relationship Journeys: Funnel and Waterfall Models | Waterfall models offer a structured way to map the relationship between buyers and sellers over time. They help organizations track how accounts move through defined stages of engagement and opportunity creation. Some models begin with initial sales interactions, while others take a broader view — starting from the moment an account is identified or targeted, well before direct engagement from sales. In either case, the goal is to bring consistency and visibility to the stages leading up to, and including, deal conversion. Teams selling $500K to $750K solutions are the most likely to use opportunity-based waterfall models—suggesting a focus on buying-stage progression. But they also top the list for lead-based models, highlighting how legacy and modern practices often coexist.",

      "Measurement Practices in Traditional Demand Gen | Non-ABM demand generation refers to traditional marketing efforts aimed at generating leads and driving interest across a broad audience, rather than focusing on a specific list of target accounts. Unlike account-based marketing (ABM), which prioritizes tailored engagement with a defined set of high-value accounts, non-ABM demand gen typically casts a wider net to attract any potential buyers who may be in-market.",
      "These programs often rely on tactics such as content syndication, paid search, broad email campaigns, social advertising, and SEO—measured using metrics like MQLs (Marketing Qualified Leads), lead volume, conversion rates, and form fills. The goal is to build pipeline at scale, even if many of the leads aren’t from high-priority accounts.",

      "Account Engagement and Intent Metrics | Account engagement and intent signals offer critical visibility into buyer behavior across both owned and external channels. Engagement reflects actions taken by individuals within a target account—such as visiting key web pages, attending webinars, or interacting with emails—while intent signals capture broader interest based on off-site research and content consumption. Together, these indicators help marketing teams identify which accounts are actively exploring solutions and where they may be in the buying journey.",
