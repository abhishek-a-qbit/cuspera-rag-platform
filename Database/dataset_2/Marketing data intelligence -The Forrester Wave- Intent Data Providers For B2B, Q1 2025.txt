B2B Intent Providers Are Raising The Bar With Rapidly 
Advancing Capabilities

The Forrester Wave TM: Intent Data Providers For B2B, Q1 2025 | 001a000001AFEaHAAX | 2e99d146 
The rules of the game have changed dramatically since our previous 
B2B intent Forrester WaveTM, published in 2023. Increased investment 
combined with rapid advancement of technical capabilities have 
redefined what is considered on par for several key evaluation criteria, 
while new capabilities are driving competition in areas that were not 
even on most roadmaps two years ago. Advances in the LLMs that 
drive generative Al (genAl) have fueled intent capture across over 150 
languages and made it possible to scale insight capture from 
unstructured data sources like audio and video recordings. 
Improvements in identity resolution, including advanced device ID 
graphs, are expanding capabilities to parse account-level intent signals 
by contact persona. Our report reflects these market changes as well 
as feedback from Forrester clients on the importance of driving intent 
adoption to maximize their investments. 
With these advances in mind, B2B intent data customers using this 
evaluation to inform a purchase decision should: 
1. Take a fresh look at available data across geographies outside 
North America. Most providers in this evaluation have invested in 
increasing their intent offering in EMEA, APAC, and LATAM. In 
addition to increased signal capture in English, most have 
introduced the capability to interpret signals across six to 10 key 
languages, with top performers leveraging Al-based translation to 
understand many times that many. While overall capture of non- 
English intent is still typically less than 20% of total signal volume, 
it has still contributed to significant growth in global data capture. 
2. Evaluate growing capabilities for persona-level insight. While 
opted-in contact-level intent is still rare in the market, persona- 
level analysis and buying group prediction are now among the 
most hotly contested features. These capabilities rely on mapping 
device IDs, hashed emails, and other anonymized persistent

The Forrester WaveTM: Intent Data Providers For B2B, Q1 2025 | 001a000001AFEaHAAX | 2e99d146 
identifiers to power predictions of the individuals responsible for 
account-level signals. This does not typically include personally identifiable information (PII), but top performers can provide insight into the likely size of the potential buying group, as well as 
breakdowns of account-level intent by personas using predicted 
job level and department. 
3. Focus on providers with a business model built for your needs. 
Providers listed represent four business models with differing 
strengths. Traditional data providers offer third-party signals as a 
standalone product. Software platforms offer signals as part of a 
platform subscription while competing on their analytics and 
activation capabilities. Campaign execution firms generate signals 
in support of marketing services, rolling the cost into activation 
fees or cost per lead. Walled gardens collect signals for specific 
industries directly from their own users on properties like review 
sites or user communities with pricing similar to traditional data 
providers. 
Evaluation Summary 
The Forrester WaveTM evaluation highlights Leaders, Strong Performers, 
and Contenders (see Figures 1 and 2). We intend this evaluation to be a 
starting point only and encourage clients to view product evaluations 
and adapt the findings based on their priorities using Forrester's 
interactive vendor comparison experience.

Leaders 
6sense 
6sense is a large platform provider with differentiated analytics and a 
growing partner ecosystem that positions it as a central player in the 
market. While several competitors are rapidly closing the gap, 6sense 
remains among the most innovative players in the market. 
1. Strategy. With an analytics-first strategy, 6sense seeks to set itself 
apart from most intent providers as your centralized source for 
marketing and sales insights. In addition to native keyword intent, 
a unique bring-your-own-data model easily integrates competitor 
signals into the core 6sense dataset, allowing clients to maximize

8/11/25, 4:56 PM 
The Forrester Wave TM: Intent Data Providers For B2B, Q1 2025 | 001a000001AFEaHAAX | 2e99d146 
the value of their total intent investment. Other tech platforms and 
data providers prioritize integration with 6sense, providing an 
ecosystem advantage. The intent-specific roadmap is a standout, 
suggesting continued staying power as an innovator. 
2. Capabilities. Top identity resolution and noise filtering help power 
outstanding intent reporting and insight generation. A high volume 
of signals across a wide range of keywords make 6sense an option 
for most industries. Detailed buying cycle analysis tailored to each 
client offering allows precision targeting. A lack of persona-based 
insights beyond captured first-party interactions is a rare below-par 
score. Data capture combines a publisher network with several 
smaller signal sources, including a small walled garden presence. 
3. Customer feedback. Customers continue to be impressed with the 
sophistication and business value offered across both marketing 
and sales use cases, though they suggest more data transparency 
behind predictive model scores. Several references indicate that 
new clients should be prepared for a significant learning curve in 
the early stages of implementation. 
4. Forrester's take. 6sense is a top-performing option for customers 
looking for strong analytics support and a centralized platform for 
marketing and sales insight and activation. 
View 6sense's detailed scorecard. 
TechTarget 
TechTarget (now called Informa TechTarget) is a technology-focused 
walled garden provider with a differentiated offering of contact-level 
intent. The merger of TechTarget and Informa Tech's digital business 
brings significant new data sources, including the publisher and partner 
ecosystem of NetLine, a promising recent entrant to the intent market.

The Forrester Wave TM: Intent Data Providers For B2B, Q1 2025 | 001a000001AFEaHAAX | 2e99d146 
1. Strategy. The combined offerings of the merged company further 
cement TechTarget's leadership position in multilevel intent 
insights against accounts, buying groups, and contacts. Its core 
strategy revolves around industry-specific intent signals captured 
from a diverse collection of owned properties, as well as online 
and in-person event activity. The company has improved the depth 
of its account-level signals, a portion of which continue to be 
attributed to opted-in contacts. A strong roadmap includes work to 
merge several newly combined datasets. 
2. Capabilities. Proprietary data is the primary differentiator for any 
walled garden provider. TechTarget builds on that strength with 
exceptional buying group identification, expanded geographic 
coverage, strong buying cycle analysis, and in-depth reporting 
capabilities within the core Priority Engine product. Customers can 
add strong persona-based analysis through an additional purchase 
of the newly acquired Intentive product. A focus on specific 
industries (primarily technology and healthcare) prior to the merger 
does limit the scope of keyword coverage. 
3. Customer feedback. Customers tell us that TechTarget has 
exceptional levels of customer support and partnership. TechTarget 
is a Customer Favorite in this evaluation. 
4. Forrester's take. TechTarget remains the go-to provider for 
contact-level intent insights across the industries it serves and is a 
compelling choice for those looking to expand their intent 
capabilities globally. 
View TechTarget's detailed scorecard. 
Intentsify 
Intentsify is a campaign execution firm with emerging platform 
capabilities, offering stiff competition to the top players despite

8/11/25, 4:56 PM 
The Forrester Wave TM: Intent Data Providers For B2B, Q1 2025 | 001a000001AFEaHAAX | 2e99d146 
entering the market only six years ago. It continues to be well 
positioned to challenge established players in the market. 
1. Strategy. Intent is at the core of Intentsify's strategy (hence the 
name), and it shows. High-end analytics, bespoke-for-everyone 
modeling, and a significant investment in R&D help drive 
differentiation. The introduction of the Intentsify Orbit identity 
graph in 2024 ranks among the most significant innovations in the 
space over the past two years, driving persona-based analysis and 
improved buying group prediction. The roadmap of intent-specific 
features is impressive, though a smaller partner ecosystem than 
other leaders is a primary area for improvement. 
2. Capabilities. Insight generation and persona-based analysis are 
standout capabilities, making an upcharge for features powered by 
Intentsify Orbit a worthwhile investment for most clients. Like other 
Leaders competing on analytics, Intentsify's accuracy, noise 
filtering, and identity resolution earned top scores. Strong growth 
in geographic coverage is among the company's most significant 
improvements from our previous evaluation. On the other hand, 
available data integrations lag peers. Data collection is primarily 
bidstream, supplemented by a B2B content site co-op, a content- 
sharing tool, and web crawling. 
3. Customer feedback. Customers highlight Intentsify's exceptional 
level of support and their trust in the quality of its data insights. 
They also point out that Intentsify's user interface is not yet at the 
level of top platform partners. 
4. Forrester's take. Intentsify is a compelling choice for customers 
seeking a do-it-for-you campaign execution partner with high-end 
analytics capabilities. 
View Intentsify's detailed scorecard.

Bombora 
The Forrester Wave TM: Intent Data Providers For B2B, Q1 2025 | 001a000001AFEaHAAX | 2e99d146 
Still the gold standard for account-level intent data feeds, Bombora is a 
traditional data provider that maintains its place among the Leaders on 
the strength of its exclusive co-op of B2B websites. While Bombora 
data is available inside many competitor platforms, this evaluation 
focuses on the capabilities available when purchasing from Bombora 
directly. 
1. Strategy. Bombora's partner-focused strategy allows clients to 
purchase intent data through a direct relationship, which includes 
expanded analytics capabilities, or through simple data feeds 
embedded inside most revenue marketing platforms and 
competitive intent offerings. The company has recently focused on 
scaling available signals, increasing its co-op size by about 20% 
and topic coverage by 13% over the past 18 months. 
2. Capabilities. Bombora's B2B co-op is made up primarily of sites 
with exclusive relationships, allowing for a highly unique, future- 
proofed dataset. Broad keyword coverage, expanded geographic 
reach, and strong buying cycle analysis are key differentiators. The 
intent-specific reporting available to direct customers is the best in 
this evaluation, along with its ability to deliver data to suit almost 
any use case. An emphasis on account-level intent results hinders 
buying group prediction. 
3. Customer feedback. Multiple customers cite the quality of 
Bombora's intent data as the standard by which they measure their 
other providers. They point that out receiving Bombora data 
through a partnership does not offer the same features or 
innovation that direct customers receive, and they would like to 
see a faster process for evaluating and adding topics. 
4. Forrester's take. The most recognized name in the intent data 
market remains a trusted source for high-quality account-level

Demandbase 
Demandbase is another large platform provider, competing primarily on 
data, orchestration, and automation of go-to-market (GTM) processes. 
One key element of its positioning is transparency, working to help 
customers understand how predictive insights are generated. A 
tremendous volume of intent signals and well-rounded capabilities 
across the evaluation position them as a top competitor in the space. 
1. Strategy. Demandbase focuses on maximizing its platform 
capabilities for orchestration and automation of marketing and 
sales activity as its primary differentiator. An outstanding 
ecosystem of data and software partners complements its 
orchestration strategy. The company's roadmap for intent 
development is impressive, and its focus on driving customer 
adoption earned a top score. 
2. Capabilities. Demandbase collects one of the largest signal 
volumes in the evaluation, relying primarily on bidstream to drive 
extensive keyword coverage. It offers highly accurate identity 
resolution capabilities to match those signals to accounts. 
Exceptional data integration and delivery options support its 
positioning as a full GTM orchestration partner, offering simple 
connections to most common revenue technology. 
3. Customer feedback. Customers praise Demandbase for the ease 
of integration into existing processes and technology and the 
depth of activation functionality. They suggest the company could 
do more to integrate intent insights with other key data types they 
offer.

4. Forrester's take. Demandbase is built for customers seeking a 
serious marketing and sales execution platform with a depth of 
intent coverage and strong complementary data offerings to 
support most industries. 
View Demandbase's detailed scorecard. 
ZoomInfo 
ZoomInfo is a major GTM platform player, leveraging its origins as a 
traditional data provider to position its proprietary data offerings as a 
competitive differentiator across its broad suite of software. 
1. Strategy. ZoomInfo's strategy and roadmap are heavily focused on 
harnessing the emerging capabilities of Al for data collection, 
analysis, and activation. This impressive development plan is made 
possible through the largest R&D investment of any provider in this 
evaluation. An extensive ecosystem of partners is a suitable 
complement to its strategic advantage as one of the most 
entrenched data providers in B2B. 
2. Capabilities. A diverse set of collection methodologies is a 
standout capability, ranging from traditional web activity capture to 
collection from proprietary freemium software offerings and human 
outreach. While a heavy mix of bidstream reduces the overall 
uniqueness of signal, clients highly value the relatively smaller set 
of signals collected through means that no other provider offers. In 
recent years, ZoomInfo has shown a focus on data compliance and 
future-proofing collection, while identity resolution and data 
integration are as advanced as you would expect from a top data 
company. 
3. Customer feedback. Customers are most complimentary of 
ZoomInfo's comprehensive data offerings and ability to make that 
data actionable, especially for sales. They see room to grow in the

The Forrester Wave TM: Intent Data Providers For B2B, Q1 2025 | 001a000001AFEaHAAX | 2e99d146 
company's customer success capabilities, noting a too-heavy focus 
on upsell that reduces the impact of an otherwise impressive 
adoption program. 
4. Forrester's take. ZoomInfo offers strong intent capabilities across 
most industries. Given the company's data and software footprint, 
existing customers may overlook its intent capabilities,

Strong Performers 
Madison Logic 
Madison Logic is a campaign execution firm leveraging a significant 
investment in intent data as a differentiated offering for clients. A 
favorable pricing strategy for data access makes the company a 
competitive option for clients otherwise considering more traditional 
data providers. 
1. Strategy. Madison Logic's intent strategy focuses on supporting 
white-glove marketing services, but clients investing in campaign 
execution can also access the company's substantial intent data 
feed for their own internal use at no additional cost. This 
differentiated pricing strategy is intended to encourage further 
campaign investment. The company also presents a robust 
customer adoption program with account-based marketing (ABM) 
certification that includes best practices for leveraging intent 
signals. 
2. Capabilities. Madison Logic is remarkably consistent across its 
current intent offering, demonstrating on-par capabilities nearly

throughout. Data integration options are above par, particularly 
when compared with other campaign execution peers. It has 
doubled the size of its available intent dataset over the past two 
years. It collects a large majority of signals through a network of 
over 2,000 partner sites. 
3. Customer feedback. Madison Logic receives outstanding 
feedback for its full-service support and ability to make 
collaborative recommendations to improve campaign 
performance. Customers also appreciate the lack of separate 
platform and data fees. 
4. Forrester's take. Companies considering a do-it-for-you campaign 
execution provider will likely find surprising value across other use 
cases thanks to Madison Logic's disruptive intent pricing. 
View Madison Logic's detailed scorecard. 
Data Axle 
Data Axle has a nearly 50-year history as a traditional data provider - 
the company rebranded from its previous name, Infogroup, in 2020. 
Despite this background, it is primarily positioned as a campaign 
execution firm in the intent market. 
1. Strategy. Data Axle goes to market as a services company, 
designing and executing largely bespoke ABM and lead 
generation campaigns on behalf of clients. Its extensive partner 
ecosystem for both data capture and marketing activation is a 
particular strength. Its adoption program is less developed than 
those of its closest peers, in part due to the do-it-for-you nature of 
the company's intent data services. 
2. Capabilities. Data Axle maintains an individual identity graph, 
making it a rare data provider that plays in both B2B and B2C

markets. It successfully leverages this database of individuals to 
supplement its capabilities for buying group prediction. This comes 
at a cost, however, as its most differentiated capabilities are largely 
limited to North America. The company offers strong identity 
resolution and data compliance policies befitting its core business 
as a major comprehensive data provider. An array of collection 
methodologies across a business co-op, partner networks, 
bidstream, licensed data, and its own campaign exhaust create a 
diverse set of signal types. 
3. Customer feedback. Customers praise the quality of data available 
and the performance of Data Axle's marketing services but 
describe its intent reporting as more manual than most peers. 
4. Forrester's take. Data Axle's data and campaign services present 
an intriguing option for companies looking for a more direct means 
to identify the likely buying group driving account-level intent 
signals, particularly in North America. 
View Data Axle's detailed scorecard. 
Anteriad 
Anteriad is a full-service marketing execution partner that builds highly 
customized target databases with a privacy-first approach. Intent is one 
key element within these larger datasets, used to help create and 
activate audiences as part of a broader sales and marketing data 
strategy. 
1. Strategy. Anteriad has made compliant data collection a strategic 
focus and differentiator, taking more conservative approaches to 
capturing web browsing activity than most peers. Its acquisition of 
global sales support provider BNZSA in 2023 has allowed it to 
supplement more traditional signal capture techniques with 
compliant data through direct human interaction in 26 languages.

The Forrester Wave TM: Intent Data Providers For B2B, Q1 2025 | 001a000001AFEaHAAX | 2e99d146 
2. Capabilities. Data compliance and future-proofed collection 
methodologies received top scores, along with robust capabilities 
for data integration and delivery that are competitive with leading 
traditional data providers. The offering lacks detailed buying cycle 
or persona-based analysis, and the overall intent dataset lacks a 
high percentage of signals that are likely to be unique. Anteriad 
launched international intent in 2024. While customers took note 
of the promising data quality outside North America, the overall 
volume of signals collected in other regions is not yet on par with 
peers. 
3. Customer feedback. Customers describe Anteriad's execution as 
highly targeted, and multiple references praise both its 
transparency and affordability. The most common ask is for 
improvements to its platform to offer greater data access, 
reporting, and visibility. 
4. Forrester's take. Customers looking for highly customized, 
targeted approaches to marketing and sales campaign execution 
should consider Anteriad, particularly those with a highly privacy- 
conscious corporate culture.

Dun & Bradstreet 
Dun & Bradstreet is a traditional data provider that offers D&B Buyer 
Intent either as a standalone data product or delivered inside one of 
several software platforms, such as Rev.Up ABX and Rev.Up ABX for 
Sales. 
1. Strategy. Dun & Bradstreet pursues a comprehensive data 
provider strategy, with intent data offered as a complement to its 
full suite of company, contact, financial, and technographic data 
products. The breadth and depth of data types that can be

The Forrester Wave TM: Intent Data Providers For B2B, Q1 2025 | 001a000001AFEaHAAX | 2e99d146 
combined within its tools supports this vision. The lack of clear 
focus and prioritization of intent among this broad product set is 
reflected in below-par scores for innovation and roadmap. 
2. Capabilities. Dun & Bradstreet offers outstanding data compliance 
across all its data products. On-par capabilities for reporting, 
insight generation, and data integration assume clients are 
leveraging D&B Buyer Intent inside one of the available platform 
products. The company does not currently offer persona-based 
analysis. It sources intent data through a large partner publisher 
network, data co-ops, and other licensed sources, though the 
relative breakdown of these signal types is unclear, resulting in a 
below-par score for uniqueness of signals. 
3. Customer feedback. Customers praise Dun & Bradstreet for the 
quality and variety of data available, noting its capacity to serve as 
their primary data provider across data types and its ability to 
blend those data types smoothly inside its platforms. Dun & 
Bradstreet did not provide reference customers for this evaluation. 
4. Forrester's take. Dun & Bradstreet's intent is best positioned as an 
added value for clients with an existing D&B relationship, 
particularly those using or considering the company's CDP offering 
or one of its execution platforms. 
View Dun & Bradstreet's detailed scorecard. 
RollWorks 
RollWorks is a platform provider offering intent in support of its core 
capability around digital advertising. Competitive pricing and simplicity 
of purpose are its primary selling points. 
1. Strategy. RollWorks' strategic vision for intent data is limited to its 
impact on campaign execution and digital ads in particular. A focus

The Forrester Wave TM: Intent Data Providers For B2B, Q1 2025 | 001a000001AFEaHAAX | 2e99d146 
on simplicity contributes to a less detailed future roadmap than 
peers. The highlight of its strategy is a highly competitive pricing 
model, offering a flat platform fee with no data caps, no limits on 
marketing seats, and five sales insights seats included. The 
platform fee also incorporates Bombora data, with an unusually 
large number of topics included in the base price. 
2. Capabilities. Aside from the embedded Bombora data, RollWorks' 
own keyword intent dataset is almost entirely bidstream, which 
offers a reasonable volume but lacks a source for significantly 
unique signals. Buying cycle analysis and buying group prediction 
are on par with the market, though the platform does not offer 
persona-based analysis. Uniqueness of signals, noise filter 
capabilities, reporting, and integration currently lag other platform 
providers in this evaluation. 
3. Customer feedback. Customers repeatedly highlight the ease of 
use in leveraging RollWorks' intent for their advertising. They would like to see continued platform development, especially 
improved reporting and analytics capabilities. 
4. Forrester's take. RollWorks offers a simple, effective, and 
affordable intent data option for customers with a need for ad 
platform capabilities, especially if they have the internal analytics 
skills to take advantage of the available intent feed for other use 
cases.

G2 
G2 is a walled garden provider of software-focused intent generated 
from its owned review sites. Positioned as a complementary provider,

The Forrester Wave TM: Intent Data Providers For B2B, Q1 2025 | 001a000001AFEaHAAX | 2e99d146 
G2 partners with most platform players to deliver intent inside those 
products; its most direct competitors are other walled garden offerings. 
1. Strategy. G2 sees itself evolving into a data company, providing 
key insights to drive demand generation, product positioning, and 
market intelligence. Al experimentation is more focused on ease of 
use to boost user activity (and signal volume) than to change the 
way intent is collected or activated. Receiving on-par strategy 
scores across the board, its vision, roadmap, and partner strategy 
are all well aligned to its go-to-market strategy as a 
complementary partner to most other providers in this evaluation. 
2. Capabilities. The nature of G2's focused industry offering of 
insights collected from software reviews makes it difficult to 
achieve an on-par score for criteria such as signal volume, 
keyword coverage, or collection methodologies. On the flip side, 
its offering achieved top scores for uniqueness of signal and 
strong data integration and delivery options. The lack of persona- 
based analysis and buying group prediction appear to be a 
conscious decision to offer most content without requiring opt-in 
consent. 
3. Customer feedback. G2's reference customer, as well as other 
current customers interviewed, leverage G2 as a secondary 
provider, supplementing their primary intent stream. They 
appreciate G2's ability to offer highly specific insights versus its 
competitors and the availability of later-stage buying signals. G2 provided only one reference customer for this evaluation. 
4. Forrester's take. G2 is well positioned as a value-add intent 
source for software companies and likely already offers an 
integration to your primary provider.

DemandScience 
DemandScience is a campaign execution firm that recently announced 
a merger with Terminus, an ABM platform provider. The combined 
offering will blend DemandScience's proprietary intent data offering 
with expanded platform execution capabilities. 
1. Strategy. DemandScience historically placed less emphasis on 
platform investment than peers, focusing instead on a strategy of 
highly customized, customer-specific intent to drive campaigns. 
That vision has now changed to include stronger platform 
capabilities and a larger, integrated dataset. This strategy earned 
on-par scores for vision and roadmap but lacks a clear path for 
innovation in the near term. The current partner ecosystem and 
adoption programs lag campaign execution peers. A recent 
decision to simplify outcome-based pricing and eliminate the 
platform fee is an intriguing change of pace for a company that will 
be competing as a platform player. 
2. Capabilities. DemandScience's previous platform is less 
developed than most peers due to its focus on do-it-for-you 
demand generation services. Lagging scores across several 
related criteria such as reporting, data integration, and buying 
cycle analysis may be addressed by its coming roadmap. The 
company currently offers persona-based analysis. Intent signals 
are primarily bidstream, supported by publisher co-op data. The 
size and uniqueness of this dataset still lags peers, but the 
combined intent feed will warrant reevaluation. 
3. Customer feedback. Customers appreciate DemandScience's 
customer service approach and describe the company as an 
affordable option that produces solid ROI. 
4. Forrester's take. While the potential of the combined company is 
yet to be seen, DemandScience is currently a competitively priced

option for companies seeking strong return from an intent-based 
revenue marketing partner. 
View DemandScience's detailed scorecard. 
TrustRadius 
TrustRadius is a walled garden provider of intent gathered from its own 
software review site. TrustRadius focuses on a familiar strategy among 
tech-focused walled gardens, providing a hard-to-find set of 
complementary signals as your secondary or tertiary provider. 
1. Strategy. TrustRadius focuses its strategic efforts on driving traffic 
to its review pages, branding itself as the most trusted software 
review site in the market. This creates strategic hesitation around 
data collection techniques that may feel intrusive to users, though 
its lack of focus on innovation is at odds with a significant 
contribution from intent products to the company's revenue. While 
its intent-specific strategy is not highly differentiated from peers, it 
does offer a well-developed partner ecosystem and solid adoption 
support. 
2. Capabilities. TrustRadius offers a no-frills intent product focused 
on delivering detailed activity data at the account level to clients. A 
highly unique signal set and future-proofed collection techniques 
earned high scores, though criteria focused on signal volume, 
coverage, and analytics capabilities are below par. 
3. Customer feedback. Customers value TrustRadius' exclusive 
signals and intel on competitive evaluation and note its strong 
customer service. Most do not consider TrustRadius to be a direct 
competitor to their primary intent providers. TrustRadius did not 
provide reference customers for this evaluation.

4. Forrester's take. TrustRadius provides valuable insights for 
software companies that can afford to invest in multiple sources of 
intent signals, particularly for those considered with comparison 
shopping behaviors among their prospects or existing customers. 
View TrustRadius' detailed scorecard. 
Spiceworks Ziff Davis 
Spiceworks Ziff Davis (SWZD) operates in a hybrid model: part 
campaign execution firm and part walled garden. The company 
captures exclusive signals from a variety of owned properties, though 
most signals come from more traditional sources. 
1. Strategy. SWZD has an interesting strategic approach to intent, 
combined with a logical roadmap, but a lack of prioritization and 
investment to date has kept the offering from fully realizing its 
potential. The company received below-par scores for partner 
ecosystem, adoption, and a somewhat opaque pricing strategy. 
SWZD brings a promising story into the Wave evaluation, but 
execution against that strategy to date has been incomplete. 
2. Capabilities. The most impactful element of the company's current 
offering is the diversity of the collection methodologies it employs. 
The bulk of the data comes from the bidstream, but proprietary 
signals are captured from an impressive range of owned 
properties, including the Spiceworks Community, Spiceworks 
News and Insights, Spiceworks Cloud Help Desk, PCMag, and 
Mashable. The dataset now includes a significant volume of data 
from recently acquired CNET properties, though this work was not 
completed in time to be reflected in data coverage scores. With

other planned product enhancements not yet complete, however, 
scores still lagged across multiple categories related to analytics 
and reporting, data compliance, and integrations. 
3. Customer feedback. Customer references point out that while 
SWZD still has work to do to fully productize its offering, the 
insights available are impressive, and the service and support are 
strong. Only one of SWZD's reference customers responded to 
Forrester's outreach for this evaluation. 
4. Forrester's take. SWZD offers an enticing mix of intent signal types 
that will be valuable to tech-focused clients with the internal 
marketing and analytics capabilities to fully act on them.

Evaluation Overview 
We evaluated providers against three categories: 
1. Current offering. Each provider's position on the vertical axis of 
the Forrester Wave graphic indicates the strength of its current 
offering. 
2. Strategy. Placement on the horizontal axis indicates the strength 
of the providers' strategies, including elements such as vision and 
innovation. 
3. Customer feedback. A halo on a provider's marker indicates 
above-average customer feedback relative to the other evaluated 
providers. A double halo indicates outstanding customer feedback: 
We consider the provider to be a Customer Favorite. As part of this 
evaluation, we speak with up to three customers of each provider. 
We also consider customer input from our previous research.

The Forrester Wave TM: Intent Data Providers For B2B, Q1 2025 | 001a000001AFEaHAAX | 2e99d146 
Vendor Inclusion Criteria 
Each of the providers we included in this assessment has: 
1. Second- or third-party proprietary intent data. Providers must 
demonstrate their own proprietary means of collecting either 
second- or third-party intent signals that are made available to all 
intent clients. This does not include signals captured on behalf of 
clients for their exclusive use. Forrester did not include pure data 
aggregators or resellers that don't also offer their own proprietary 
data. We gave preference for inclusion toward providers that add a 
significant volume of proprietary intent signals to the market. 
2. Substantial intent data revenue. The provider has at least $10 
million in annual revenue from customers leveraging its intent data 
offerings in the past four quarters. 
3. Mindshare among Forrester's enterprise clients. Forrester clients 
frequently mention the offering as one they are considering or 
shortlisting prior to a purchase. We have heard about the 
provider's intent offering from our clients in the form of inquiries, 
advisories, consulting engagements, and other interactions over 
the past 12 months. Other providers frequently mention this 
provider as a competitor in the market. 
Other Notable Vendors

the market; it doesn't represent the entire vendor landscape. You'll find 
more information about this market and additional providers that 
Forrester considers to be notable for enterprise clients in our

did not evaluate in this report: 
1. Foundry. The intent product we evaluated in 2023 is no longer 
generally available for sale; it's now offered exclusively as a benefit 
to members of Foundry's partner network. 
2. PharosIQ (formerly MRP). MRP announced a merger with 
CONTENTgine in 2024, repositioning the combined organization 
as pharosIQ, a broader marketing services firm that does not 
position itself to compete as a full-service intent data provider. 
Supplemental Material 
The Forrester Wave Methodology 
A Forrester Wave is a guide for buyers considering their purchasing 
options in a technology marketplace. To offer an equitable process for 
all participants, Forrester follows The Forrester WaveTM Methodology to 
evaluate participating vendors. 
In our review, we conduct primary research to develop a list of vendors 
to consider for the evaluation. From that initial pool of vendors, we 
narrow our final list based on the inclusion criteria. We then gather 
details of product and strategy through a detailed questionnaire, 
demos and briefings, and interviews with customers (vendors may 
provide up to three reference customers; we also consider feedback 
from other customers we've spoken with). We use those inputs, along 
with the analyst's experience and expertise in the marketplace, to score 
vendors, using a relative rating system that compares each vendor 
against the others in the evaluation. 
We include the publishing date (quarter and year) clearly in the title of 
each Forrester Wave report. We evaluated the vendors participating in 
this Forrester Wave using materials they provided to us by December

6, 2024 and did not allow additional information after that point. We 
encourage readers to evaluate how the market and vendor offerings 
change over time. 
In accordance with our vendor review policy, Forrester asks vendors to 
review our findings prior to publishing to check for accuracy. We score 
vendors that met our defined inclusion criteria but declined to 
participate in or contributed only partially to the evaluation in 
accordance with our vendor participation policy and publish their 
positioning along with those of the participating vendors. 
Dun & Bradstreet and TrustRadius declined to participate in the full 
Forrester Wave evaluation process. For vendors that are not full 
participants, Forrester uses primary and secondary research in its 
analysis. For example, we might use public information, data gathered 
via briefings, and independently sourced customer interviews to score 
the vendor. We may ask the vendor for an abbreviated briefing and/or 
to provide reference customers. We may also rely on estimates to 
score vendors. 
Integrity Policy 
We conduct all our research, including Forrester Wave evaluations, in 
accordance with the integrity policy posted on our website.
