Foreword by Henrik Larsson Broman
A NEW ERA OF AI-DRIVEN SALES IS HERE

However, ChatGPT is just one example of the new wave of AI solutions affecting our daily lives. Technological developments give us a glimpse into the future and how AI will affect our lives and
work. While we may sometimes long for the “good old days” before e-commerce, social media and intelligent conversation tools like ChatGPT, it is impossible to ignore the progress.

Ignoring these rapid developments is like sailing against the wind. Instead, it is time to adapt, embrace change and prepare for a new era.

At Mercuri International, we have chosen to see this rapid development as an exciting opportunity, especially in areas we hold dear such as sales, marketing, customer service and leadership. With AI, we can make a difference and streamline many tasks that were previously time-consuming and manual.

In December 2022, OpenAI, a San Francisco-
based company specializing in artificial intelligence, launched a groundbreaking language model called ChatGPT. ChatGPT represents a new era in AI, acting  as a virtual assistant that can handle a variety of questions and interact with users in a natural
and human-like way. The response to ChatGPT was nothing short of a sensation. Within just five days, over one million users had joined, and within two months, over 100 million people had engaged with their new assistant. This made ChatGPT the fastest growing application in history. To put this in perspective: TikTok took nine months to reach the same number of users, Instagram two years, and YouTube over four years.

Its huge success is a sign of the rapid development of artificial intelligence and how it has the power to redefine our digital world. This revolution has both enthusiasts and skeptics, and it has raised  questions about what will happen to jobs and what risks are associated with the new era.

In this report,  which is part of a series, we will focus on sales. We will explore the opportunities that AI creates for the different parts of the sales process: from analyzing the target audience to winning the deal and taking care of existing customers. What
can be automated, and what tools are available? We can’t cover everything, as developments in AI are constant, with new innovations emerging every day. Instead, it aims to highlight the possibilities of AI, showcase selected examples and inspire new ideas. Feel free to use it as an encyclopedia and guide in the changing world of artificial intelligence.

Compiling the report has not been an easy task. But I have been greatly assisted by futurologist Peter Siljerud, who has been a great support in both analysis and writing.

Introduction
WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?

Have you ever wondered how often you use artificial intelligence (AI)? In fact, most of us use AI on a daily basis without even thinking about it. Every time you use your fingerprint or Face ID to unlock your phone, you are using AI. Every time you use Facebook or Instagram, the ads you see
are adapted based on AI. Every time you translate text with Google Translate, AI is working in the background. Even when you browse online and get book recommendations, it’s the result of AI analysis, and when you press the order button, your payment card is checked by AI to detect any unauthorized use.

So AI has a major impact on our daily lives, even if many people are not aware of it. A survey conducted a few years ago showed that







84% of us used AI on a

And its use will only increase  in the future. If digitalization has been the big topic in the 21st century, AI will dominate the discussion in the coming years. We are probably witnessing the most dramatic shift in technology since the advent of the internet.

But what exactly is AI? This is a question on which the experts are not entirely unanimous. AI is a multi-faceted concept that is often misused, and even among researchers there is no consistent definition. At a basic level, it can be described
as the ability of machines to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as problem solving, learning and decision
making. In contrast to our biological intelligence, computers and machines drive this form of intelligence. One way to look at it is that AI takes in information  (such as data or input from the environment), interprets it and learns from it to achieve specific goals.

solutions is not new. In fact, the first neural networks were deployed as early as 1959 to manage echoes on telephone lines. But it took several decades for the technology to make a breakthrough. Modern AI is different from older systems that were rule-based and static. Instead, it is based on machine learning, which means that computers can train and improve their skills over time.

The goal of machine learning is to create systems that resemble the human ability to identify and understand the world around us. It involves handling images, speech, text and other types of information that were previously challenging for

computers.  For example, multiplying 2,539,342 by 4,393,245 is ridiculously easy for a computer but complicated for a human. Conversely, a human being finds it easy to recognize, for example, a dog in a picture, while a computer has traditionally found this type of analysis very
difficult. But with rapid development, computers can now do this too.

What we see today is mainly so-called ‘narrow
AI’. They are systems that are specialized to solve specific problems and tasks. The next step in development is to create AI that can handle more general problems. When computers reach that

level, we talk about ‘artificial general intelligence’ (AGI). This would be an intelligence similar to that of a human in its ability to think, understand and learn, and solve problems in a way that is similar
or superior to human capabilities. AGI does not yet exist, and there is an intense  debate about whether it can be created and whether we should be concerned about it. Whether we will reach
that point, we can only speculate at this stage.

AI IN B2B SALES: FUTURE
OPPORTUNITIES


Historically, the world of sales was based around a basic concept - people meeting to exchange goods or services in return for some form of value. The system was simple: people traded what they had in surplus for what they needed to survive. Over time, the use of currencies, such as coins
and banknotes, developed to facilitate trade.

During the Industrial Revolution, sales became more systematic and efficient. Mass production enabled the manufacture of large quantities of goods, and sales methods were developed to market and distribute these goods to a wider audience. Over time, the profession of sales took shape, with professional salespeople developing methods and techniques to convince customers of the value of their goods and services.

In modern times, technology has revolutionized sales. First came the internet, and with it
e-commerce, social media and global marketing platforms. They all opened up a universe of new opportunities and fundamentally changed the business landscape. Then came the era of smart phones, where the world was suddenly in our pockets. Again, it changed the fundamentals of not only how we sell, but also how we live, work and communicate with each other in general.

And now everything is changing again. Although selling is still about convincing customers to
buy a product, service or idea in exchange for something of value, usually money, the way we do it is changing.


Artificial intelligence (AI) provides new opportunities to further automate, improve and streamline parts of the

sales process that were previously manual and time- consuming.



This frees up time and resources for a sales department, allowing it to focus on more relationship-building or strategic tasks, streamlining the sales process and creating more high-quality customer interactions. But there
is also the opportunity to build a better, more personalized customer experience.

One of the most fascinating things about AI is that it is a form of general purpose basic technology. AI is not limited to a specific area, but is something that can be applied widely. This means that in most sales activities there are one or more players offering solutions. For those working in this field, there is thus every reason  to familiarize themselves with the available tools to assess which ones may be relevant in their own organization. This report is intended to facilitate this task. It provides a map for orientation in
the AI landscape, with examples of tools that can make the seller’s life easier. It provides an overview of the current supply that will help  you feel more confident and secure in discussions with external suppliers.

The new AI-based tools are not only better than the previous ones, but often add completely new functionalities that we haven’t seen before. For example,  AI can analyze large amounts of data to identify and qualify which potential customers  are most likely to be interested in your products or services. With generative AI, even time-consuming tasks such as writing and responding to emails and generating relevant and engaging content can be optimized and automated.




In fact, current generative AI has the potential to automate tasks that steal 60 to 70 percent of employees’ time today.2

AI can also be useful in analyzing and creating customer value, conducting virtual customer meetings, engaging potential customers
on social media, as well as producing sales presentations, quotes and tender proposals. AI also has the potential to streamline and improve the process of onboarding, nurturing, developing and retaining existing customers. For example, chatbots and various types of AI-based assistants can answer customers’ questions 24 hours a day while predicting which customers are about to leave.

The possibilities with AI are endless. But
as with any new technology, there are also many challenges. Ethical and moral aspects are important to consider, as well as how to
implement AI successfully in the company. But when properly managed, the opportunities outweigh the risks. By using AI, companies can increase their efficiency, reduce their costs and improve their competitiveness, as we highlight in this report.

Introduction
1.1 AI TO FIND YOUR TARGET
AUDIENCE


In an increasingly digitalized world, selling is no longer based solely on intuition and personal networks. It has become an advanced science, where every step is strategically designed and supported by technology.


At the center of this revolution is AI (Artificial Intelligence) and its ability to redefine how we reach and convert potential customers.



Prospecting is an important cornerstone of successful sales. This is the initial phase where you identify potential customers or “leads” and develop lists of possible customers who may be interested
in your products and services. The aim is then to engage and convert these potential customers into buying customers.

The exploration phase is critical to the survival and growth of any business. Without a steady stream of potential customers to approach, the sales
department would struggle to achieve its goals and contribute to the important work of ensuring the company’s growth as well as profitability.

In this effort to identify and find potential customers, AI has come to play a major role. The manual search process has been replaced by advanced AI that can identify potential customers with greater precision than before. It can analyze data from various
sources, including company databases, social media and web activities to help sellers become more accurate in their approach.

In this chapter, we therefore provide some examples of how AI can facilitate and improve this stage of the sales process.



1.2 AI-GENERATED IDEAL
CUSTOMER PROFILES


A key part of effective prospecting is to develop a detailed description of which customers to target and why. This is known as the ideal customer profile, (ICP) and refers to the type of company
or organization that best fits your company’s products or services.

An ICP serves two purposes.



First, it helps  companies focus their resources and efforts on reaching the most relevant customers who are most profitable and valuable to your business and who have the greatest potential to buy from you. This saves time and money that could otherwise be wasted on trying to reach audiences that are not interested in or have no need for your products or services.









Secondly, it helps the company to create more effective marketing campaigns and sales strategies. When you know exactly who your ideal customers are, you can create tailored messages and offers that speak directly to their needs and tastes. In other words, it means  developing a profile that describes in detail the characteristics of the types of companies and decision-makers we should target with our sales and marketing efforts.

Let’s look at an example for company Z, which sells business loans to SMEs. Their ICP could be described as follows:

Company profile:

Has been on the market for at least 2 years

Turnover between 1 and 50 million SEK per year

Need to borrow money to expand or to manage cash flow

Looking for a quick and easy loan application without complicated processes and
collateral requirements

Have a good credit rating or have previously paid their debts on time


Decision-makers:

CEO or CFO

Responsible for the company’s economy and finance

Looking for a reliable and flexible lender to help with the company’s financing needs

Can make decisions on loan applications without delays or lengthy decision-making processes


Needs:

Need funding to expand the business, buy new equipment or manage cash flow

Looking for a flexible lender who can offer tailor-made solutions for the company’s specific needs

Looking for a smooth loan application and a quick decision-making process without complicated paperwork or collateral requirements

Looking for low interest rates and reasonable terms that fit the company’s budget




Challenges:

Has previously had difficulty getting approved for business loans with traditional banks

Need a lender who can offer financing without collateral or other complicated processes

Want to avoid high interest rates and expensive fees that can affect the profitability of the business



An ICP is always based on data on the target group. A good first step is therefore to collect and analyze data on existing and potential customers. This may involve analyzing factors such as customers’ purchase history, products or services purchased, needs, buying patterns, number of purchases, purchase amounts and recurring purchases and then matching it with demographic factors such as company size, industry and geographical location.

The data collection can also be complemented by market research data such as customer interviews and surveys, but also public data such as industry registers and market statistics. For those who want to go deeper, social media data can also be collected and analyzed.


This is known as social listening or sentiment analysis and involves following dialogues in social networks to gain a deeper insight into customers’ problems, expectations and desires when it comes to
the company’s products or services.

As always, when analyzing large amounts of data, AI can be very helpful. This is also true when it comes to developing ideal customer profiles. Several of the major CRM providers such as Salesforce, Hubspot and Zoho CRM have AI built into their systems which allows them to do this analysis with a few simple commands based on the data in the system. But there are also more specialized players such as Clearbit and 6sense, both of which use AI to help companies identify which customers are most valuable to them.

Once the ICP is established, it may be worthwhile to carry out a ‘twin analysis’. This means that
we compare the ideal customer profile with a database of potential customers. This allows us to identify and develop lists of companies with similar profiles to target.

One company that offers this type of solution is Rev. Rev’s algorithms analyze customer data to identify patterns and trends associated with high- value customers. The platform then uses this information to find prospects who share similar characteristics, making it easy for businesses to target their campaigns to customers who are
more likely to buy.

This platform also uses predictive analytics, which means  that it uses artificial intelligence to predict future events and customer behavior based on historical data and patterns. The purpose of this is to identify customers who are more likely to buy
or be attracted to a particular product or service. In practice, this means building over time a qualified group of customers who are well suited to the company’s products and services and who resemble the ICP.

The benefits of using a tool like Rev are many. By automating the process of identifying twins to our ideal customers, companies can save time
and money, while improving the accuracy of their targeting.  In addition,  by targeting customers who share characteristics with their best current
customers, companies can increase the likelihood of converting these prospects into customers, which, properly managed, drives growth and profitability.

1.3 AI-GENERATED BUYER
PROFILES


Another concept that is increasingly common in the identification of potential customers is the definition of buyer personas. If ideal customer profiles are about describing the characteristics and attributes of your target audience at company level, buyer profiles are about describing your target audience at individual level. In other words, what characterizes the decision-makers of your ideal customers? What are their challenges? What are their needs?
What is their position? What are their purchasing behaviors? Do they have any distinctive personality traits?

Buyer profiles are fictional but realistic descriptions of the decision makers or decision influencers we target and often include a full name and photo so they can be treated as real individuals. In this way, we can help sellers to better meet their needs and become better advisors. Buyer profiles also allow the marketing department (which does not always get to
meet customers face-to-face) to gain a better understanding of the target audience.

Personal characteristics may involve describing things like professional background, age group, nationality, sources of information, attitudes and beliefs, but also individual personality traits.

Job-related characteristics include, for example, describing the role, objectives, challenges, tasks and KPIs of the buyer profile.

Buying characteristics involves understanding the buying profile’s decision-making process, decision criteria, common objections and barriers to, for example, switching suppliers.

It is of course up to each individual to decide which elements should be included in a buyer profile, but usually they are divided into
personal characteristics, work- related characteristics and purchasing characteristics. Briefly, these can be
described as follows:








     Buyer profiles are fictional but realistic descriptions of the decision makers or decision influencers we target and often include  a full name and photo so they can be treated as real individuals.




Developing buyer profiles can be more or less complex. If you want to do it from scratch, you should, as with ideal customer profiles, analyze data collected on existing customers. But there are also several AI-based tools that can do this analysis based on public data from websites and social media, for example.

An exciting example of this is Delve  AI. This AI tool allows you to choose whether to analyze data from your own CRM system or external data. If you want to analyze your own customer data, select the Customer Persona option. If you want to create customer profiles based on external data, select one of the options - Live Persona, Social Persona
or Competitor Persona.


Live Persona uses Google Analytics data to create buyer profiles for your website. Social Persona generates buyer profiles based on the audience your business interacts with on
social media. Competitor Persona works in the same way but produces buyer profiles for your competitors. Just enter the link to your own or your competitor’s website and in an instant you have a result that shows the typical goals, needs, position, preferences, interests and values of the buyer profile. It can also provide industry-specific insights and differentiate between B2C and B2B.

Another solution is getitout.io. By entering a job title that aligns with your target audience, such as “sales director”, their AI creates a profile including common problems, challenges and

goals but also insights based on demographics and firmographics.

As with many other tasks, language models such as ChatGPT can also be used as a guide to generate buyer profiles. If you have developed a detailed description of your target audience or ideal customer, you can ask ChatGPT to develop a buyer profile based on this information. For example, you can use an instruction like this:

“Develop a detailed buyer profile for our [target group/ideal customer profile], taking into account their demographics, behaviors and preferences.”

Another exciting solution for creating buyer profiles based on the personality profiles of the target audience is Crystal Knows. Crystal uses
AI to collect and analyze text data from people’s language and behavior in email and social media to create gender-neutral personality profiles,
known as DISC profiles. The profile includes details of the person’s behavioral and communication style, personality type and preferences and
also provides concrete suggestions on how
to appropriately adapt the message, tone and content to the profile’s individual characteristics.

Based on data on our own customers, but also using AI-based tools that retrieve public data on our target audience, we can extract buyer
profiles of our desired ideal customers. With these insights, we can then tailor personalized content in
our marketing campaigns.

1.4 AI TO FIND AND DEVELOP
LISTS OF YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE

We have now described how AI can be used to identify and produce descriptions of both ideal customer and buyer profiles. This analysis is important for several reasons, not least because we will now be able to identify and produce
lists and contact details of the potential client companies and decision-makers that fit the description provided by the analysis in order to proactively target them with marketing and sales efforts.


One method for building  a list of potential leads that match ideal customer and buyer profiles is to research publicly available sources, such as company databases, industry news and social media.



By analyzing these sources, relevant information about companies and decision-makers can
be gathered. This can include factors such as company size, turnover, geographical location, industry, and decision-makers, but also more detailed information on the needs of different companies.

For example, a B2B company offering energy efficiency solutions for industries can use AI to
find potential customers by analyzing news, social media and company information. The AI tool can identify companies that have recently expressed

interest in reducing their energy costs, invested in sustainability initiatives, or are going through a growth phase that requires a review of their energy use. Based on these insights, the AI tool can generate a list of potential customers who
are most likely to be interested in the company’s energy efficiency solutions.

Today, there are several AI-based solutions to
do this. For example,  you can use Linkedin Sales Navigator to identify and find companies and decision makers that match your ideal customer profile or have expressed a particular need. In practice, you log into your account and enter the criteria that match your ideal customer profile, such as industry, company size, geography or more specific criteria such as whether they have recently received funding or expanded their workforce. Next, you can enter criteria that match your buyer profile such as title or whether they have recently shown interest in your products
or services. You can then save this list to interact with and engage the target audience.

Other AI-based tools that can be used to find potential leads according to a predefined ideal customer profile are LeadIQ, Lusha, Cognism
and Apollo. For the Nordic market, there are tools
like Vainu. Using AI and machine learning, these tools analyze publicly available data sources to find, collect, and verify email addresses, phone numbers, and other relevant information about potential leads. All of these can also be integrated with Linkedin, Salesforce  and other CRM systems to keep the list up to date.

In addition to these methods for finding and collecting information on potential leads, there are also tools for collecting information on website  visitors. Leadfeeder is one such tool. By




tracking the visitor’s IP address and matching it with company information  in their database,  it can generate lists of companies that have shown interest in your website, including company name, size, industry and contact information, providing insights into which companies are interested in your products or services.

By using these and other AI-based tools, B2B companies can improve and automate their prospecting, resulting in more qualified and relevant leads that increase the likelihood of successful sales.

Introduction
2.1 AI TO ENGAGE YOUR
TARGET AUDIENCE


With a clear strategy in place about which companies and decision-makers to target and why, the important work of engaging the target audience and establishing contact begins.
This can include creating and sharing relevant, valuable and informative content tailored to your target audience (content marketing), sending personalized messages and offers by email or
text message, building relationships on social media, participating in fairs and events, all kinds of advertising, or simply contacting your target audience by phone to set up a personal meeting.

In this chapter, we focus on some common methods that salespeople can use and how AI can facilitate and streamline the process of getting potential customers engaged and interested in products and services. Here are some examples:

AI to develop compelling value messages

AI to engage prospects with emails



















If you want to know how AI can be used to engage and generate leads in marketing, we recommend you read our report “AI-driven marketing” which you can download at www.mercuri.net.

2.2 AI-GENERATED VALUE
MESSAGES


A first step in engaging and connecting with your target audience is to develop a compelling value message.


The value message is at the heart of how sellers communicate the unique value and benefits of their products or services to potential customers.



In short, it is your description of why the customer should meet you or choose to buy from you over your competitors.

The benefits of a compelling value message are many. As well as giving salespeople clear guidelines on how to approach and convince customers, it also makes  it clear to the customer what they will gain from investing in your products or services and what differentiates you from the competition.


By communicating the value clearly and convincingly,
you can also help customers make decisions faster and shorten the sales cycle.
This saves time and

resources for both sellers and customers.



A value message can be formulated in a shorter overall sentence such as Tesla’s “Accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy” or IBM’s “Building a smarter planet”. However, they can also be more direct in their wording to be used,
for example, to book a meeting with a potential customer.

Let’s say you sell software solutions to logistics companies. Your value message could then be:

“Our software solution is designed to streamline logistics operations in a way that reduces your transportation costs by as much as 20% while increasing your delivery speed by 15%. Unlike many other  players, we use AI to manage
and monitor the entire logistics process in an automated way, from order management to freight tracking and returns management.”

A value message is thus a powerful component
of the sales process, helping to create compelling arguments for why customers should choose you. It is a constant reminder that it is the customer’s needs that are at the heart of any successful business.

However, developing a compelling value message can be challenging. Research shows that 94% of all B2B value messages are undifferentiated. In other words, most value messages do not stand out or cause customers to perceive a distinct difference between different suppliers.3

3https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/94-b2b-value-propositions-worldwide-un-differentiated-johnston/




However, using AI can both simplify and improve the process. Today, there are several tools that can quickly and effectively provide ideas for powerful value messages. Writecream is an example. This service is aimed at entrepreneurs and business owners who are looking for an
automated and accurate method to create a well- defined value proposition for their product or service. Type in the name and description of your

product or service and the generator will produce different value message options.

Another AI-based service is Autorytr. Their AI engine generates alternative value messages that resonate with your target audience in seconds. Finally, Frase and Scalenut can also create
unique value messages for your company’s products or services.

2.3 AI-GENERATED EMAILS
TO ENGAGE THE TARGET AUDIENCE

A common method to contact, approach and engage decision-makers within the desired target group is to use email. It allows sellers to communicate customized and personalized value messages, share information and build relationships over time. However, there are several challenges to communicating via
email. Open rates are often low, content can be perceived as impersonal or misdirected, and it can be time-consuming. Some studies suggest that salespeople spend between 20 and 30 percent of their time answering, writing and
sending emails. The variations are of course great depending on the task, but with the help of AI there are great gains to be made by streamlining and improving the salesperson’s customer communication.

Today, there are several large AI-driven platforms, so-called “Sales Engagement Platforms”, which, among other things, support salespeople and marketers to automate and optimize e-mail messages so that recipients open, click or
respond to e-mails to a greater extent.

Outreach and Salesloft are two examples of such providers. Outreach gives salespeople the ability to automate and schedule emails to prospects. This saves time and ensures  that messages are sent at optimal times. The platform also enables the creation of email templates that can be customized for each individual recipient to make the message feel more personal. In addition, reminders and follow-up messages can be set to increase the likelihood of response.

Salesloft  works in a similar way. This tool offers scheduled email campaigns, insights into recipient behavior, search and segmentation tools, and AI to rank prospects based on their

activity and engagement. Autobound can be easily integrated with Outreach and Salesloft. This AI-based tool helps you quickly write personalized emails to your prospects based on news events, company initiatives, shared
experiences, technologies used, and more. Free to try, affordable to buy.

Other AI-based tools focus more on acting as an email assistant to the seller. Examples of such tools are Lavender.ai and Regie.ai. Both can be easily integrated with Outreach and Salesloft to help salespeople write engaging and personalized emails better and faster. Outreachwriter and Autobound are two other solutions that formulate personalized emails based on the customer’s digital footprint, news events, company initiatives, and insights into what you have in common with the potential customer.

Tools such as Warmbox can be used to ensure that the emails do not end up in the customer’s junk mail .

An additional tool worth mentioning in this context is Voxwave. This tool allows you to quickly and easily include voice messages in your emails to make them more personal and increase response rates. You record 1 minute of your voice on their platform, then write your message with tags (such as the recipient’s name and company) and include  this in your email. Done! According
to the company, the response rate is three times higher when a personal voice message is included in the message.

2.4 AI-DRIVEN SOCIAL SELLING


Over the past few decades, social media has become an increasingly important part of an effective sales effort. What was once a platform for personal contacts and social networks has now evolved into an integral part of B2B sales.



In practice, this means integrating social media such as LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram with traditional sales efforts
to engage, build relationships and connect with more potential customers. This work, also referred to as social selling, can consist of sharing relevant knowledge, interacting with existing and potential customers and keeping up to date with customers’ needs and activities online. The goal
is usually to develop meaningful relationships
and build trust, build your own or your company’s brand and be top-of-mind with the customer when they are ready to buy.

As social relationships increasingly move online, sellers need to keep up. Social selling has become increasingly popular in a variety of industries but
is mainly used in B2B sales or more considered consumer purchases where human interaction is of great importance. Just like in traditional customer meetings, social selling is based on dialogue rather than monologue. It is about engaging through interaction. Listen, offer insights and converse, rather than sell. As such,
the term social selling is somewhat misleading as it implies doing business on social media.

The road to success in social selling is thus one of involvement and engagement, cultivating a

relationship with the customer by acting as an expert, consultant or advisor rather than a hunter. The traditional way of pushing a message is dying out in favor of a new paradigm of inspiring and educating a target audience.



LinkedIn as a platform to engage customers

Among the major social media platforms, LinkedIn is often considered the best for B2B sellers. The reason  is that LinkedIn is specifically focused on business and professional networking.






To date, LinkedIn has acquired 810 million users, of which 65 million are decision-makers.

Users are there to build professional relationships and explore business opportunities, making it an ideal place for B2B salespeople to interact with potential customers.

AI plays a major role in the user experience on LinkedIn. Among other things, AI algorithms are used to suggest people that users may be
interested in following or “connecting” with based on their networks and interests. LinkedIn also
uses AI to personalize users’ news feeds, provide content recommendations, jobs that may be relevant to them, or translate content written in another language.

For a salesperson who wants to take advantage of LinkedIn and establish contact with the target group, there are great opportunities today. For example, the LinkedIn Sales Navigator is an invaluable resource for many when  it comes to finding and engaging new customers.

LinkedIn Sales Navigator is a premium service that offers advanced search features and filters to find and engage potential customers. This




tool helps B2B sellers identify decision-makers within relevant companies, follow industry trends and see which companies are most likely to
be interested in their products or services. By searching for companies, people and keywords using various filters such as geography, industry, company size and function, the salesperson
can quickly create a list of potential customers that match the target audience. Based on your previous searches, it also helps to identify new prospects that you may not have considered before.

To engage and connect with customers  and prospects, the InMail feature  can be used. Send personalized messages that show you know
their business and industry and understand their unique needs. By offering value and expertise right from the start, you increase the chances of engaging the customer and booking a meeting.

You can also monitor potential customers’ activities on the platform. By following their posts, comments and updates, you will get a better understanding of their needs and challenges.
Use this information to follow up in a relevant and personalized way. It also gives  you updates when customers leave and go to another employer who could be a potential customer.

For those who are particularly interested  in monitoring when customers change jobs, there are additional solutions. Champify  uses AI to keep track of when decision makers in the target audience start a new job, which can be valuable
information for a salesperson who wants to create new business opportunities but also establish
new contacts with the existing customer.



Writing and publishing posts on
LinkedIn

An effective way to engage your audience is to write and publish posts on LinkedIn. Properly managed, this can help salespeople broaden their reach, connect with their target audience and strengthen their personal brand. In practice, it is about demonstrating what expertise or skills you

have, what you believe in and what your passion and values are. All so that the target audience can get to know you and trust you even if you haven’t met.

Today, there are many AI-based tools that
can help with this work. A popular tool for this purpose is Taplio. Their goal is to help salespeople stop wasting endless  hours writing LinkedIn
posts. Based on GPT-4, the user is given ideas, inspiration and writing assistance to generate and publish posts and replies to comments in various threads. You can also generate automatic replies to people who have “liked” your post. In addition, the posts can be scheduled at the right time and provide you with statistics on what works and what doesn’t.

Another AI-powered tool that could be exciting to test is LinkoAI. This tool allows sellers to create personalized messages, tailored to specific targets. The user enters the recipient’s LinkedIn profile URL, the sender’s name, a message
type (whether it should be a friendly, funny or professional in style) and a goal (for example, if you want to book a meeting). The tool then
generates a message in just a few seconds and can also add emojis for an extra touch.

Similarly, LinkOut, SaleeAI and SayHIwork in a similar way. All of these use AI to help their users make boring and impersonal messages more articulate. Visit the recipient’s LinkedIn profile and the tools generate a customized message taking into account their company, industry, problems and goals.

Other tools are more directed towards helping salespeople write comments in various posts on LinkedIn, which for many can be a time- consuming task. Examples of such tools are EngageAI and Social Comments. With these,
a seller can save many hours by formulating engaging comments and say goodbye to general comments like “Great post!”, “Thanks for sharing” and “Love your content!”. Install a chrome extension that works on LinkedIn and you’re
good to go.

2.5 AI-BASED VIRTUAL SALES
ASSISTANTS AND CHATBOTS


Virtual sales assistants are an exciting innovation that have the potential to streamline and improve the way companies engage and interact with
their customers. Using AI and natural language processing (NLP), they can now perform a variety of tasks that include interacting with customers and prospects on their own. They work by understanding and processing people’s

questions, comments and requests via chat, email and phone, and responding to them in real time with relevant and useful answers. They can suggest customized products or services, set up meetings with salespeople, and even continue the conversation after the meeting.






Let’s look at an example.



Imagine a company that sells software solutions to other companies, and they have recently implemented an AI-based virtual sales assistant to help them with their sales efforts. A potential customer, company ABC, visits the company’s website to explore their products and learn more about their offerings. Using the virtual sales assistant, the ABC company can now engage in a chat conversation directly on the website.

The virtual sales assistant starts the conversation with a welcome greeting and asks if company ABC is interested in learning more about their products. Based on Company ABC’s answers, the virtual sales assistant can determine if they are
a potential customer by asking questions about their needs, budget and timeframe.

Having qualified company ABC as a potential customer, the virtual sales assistant can now tailor its offer. It can provide information on specific products and features relevant to the needs of

Company ABC and demonstrate the benefits of choosing their solutions.

If company ABC shows interest in continuing the conversation, the virtual sales assistant can offer to schedule a meeting with a human sales representative. It can use AI to provide calendar options and ensure the meeting is suitable for both parties.

After the meeting has taken place, the virtual sales assistant can send a follow-up email with notes from the conversation and any documents that were discussed. It continues to interact
with the company ABC by offering additional information and answering questions.

Throughout the process, the virtual sales assistant collects data on the interaction and behavior of company ABC. This information is used to generate analytics and reports that help the company understand the conversion rate and effectiveness of their sales process.






Copyright © Mercuri International                                                                                                                                                                          33




As we saw in this example,  AI-based virtual sales assistants can be used in several ways

1	First, they can be used to automate routine tasks and processes, such as lead generation, lead qualification and follow- up of potential customers. This saves
time and resources for the sales team, allowing them to focus on more complex and relationship-building aspects of the sales process.

2 	Second, AI-based virtual sales assistants can work around the clock, enabling continuous customer interaction and rapid response to customer requests. This is particularly valuable  in a global business environment where customers may be in different time zones.

3 	Third, these virtual assistants can offer tailored and personalized customer experiences. By analyzing customer data and behavior, they can provide products, services and offers that are more likely
to interest the customer, which can increase conversion rates and sales volume.

The foundation of AI-based virtual sales assistants is that they continuously learn and improve
over time. By analyzing data from previous conversations and interactions, they can develop a deeper understanding of customer behavior and preferences. This allows them to customize their responses and offers in a way that increases the chance of converting prospects into actual customers whether it’s via a chat, phone or email.

An exciting player in this field is Conversica, whose AI-based platform uses chatbots to automate communication with potential customers. In practice, these act as virtual sales assistants that automatically contact, engage and communicate with a potential customer via email until there is a concrete business opportunity to pursue. The tool can send follow-up messages, collect contact information and qualify the potential customer. If it is worth  going further, it hands over to a human salesperson.

Drift and Exceed work in a similar way. Both include chat, email and video to engage and provide personalized experiences at scale throughout the customer journey. These
sales assistants can answer questions, handle objections and respond to inquiries like human conversations while collecting data for your CRM. Once the potential customer is qualified, the virtual sales assistant schedules a meeting in the calendar of the salesperson for further processing.

Other players go further, calling their solutions
‘next generation AI salespeople’. For example, MagicForm offers a solution for hiring and training an AI chatbot tasked with converting your
website visitors into paying customers. In practice, you train it in everything it needs to know about your business while it gets smarter and smarter.
It can converse in 30 different languages, make automatic follow-ups and can work around the clock.

For those who also want to create a digital representation of a salesperson or company representative, there are also so-called virtual sales avatars. These are often an animated figure that uses AI and computer-generated
graphics to mimic a human being. Like a chatbot, they can answer questions, make product recommendations, help customers navigate a website or demonstrate a product to a potential customer. They can also be complemented by Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality to make the experience more engaging and real.

An example of this is Dave.ai. Their solution allows companies to visualize their products, such as furniture and furnishings, cars and clothing, allowing the customer to experience the products in a virtual or augmented world while being assisted by an avatar that answers questions or demonstrates the product. While this type of solution  is not suitable for everyone, it has the potential to become more widespread in the future as more and more customers want to be able to try and test different products on their
own.

2.6 AI-BASED PERSONALIZED
VIDEO MESSAGES


Over the last two decades, the consumption of moving images has grown exponentially. The simple explanation is that humans find it easier and more entertaining to watch a video rather than read text.

Text is a much more complicated, and above all slower, way of conveying complex messages.


It is estimated that the human brain processes images 60,000 times faster than text.4  For a seller, this can be of great benefit.
This is because videos allow sellers to communicate their message in a more visual
and engaging way than text-based messages such as emails or text messages. This makes it easier to grab
the recipient’s attention and keep it.



In a video,  the seller can easily demonstrate products or services, explain their features and benefits, and show how they can solve potential

customers’ problems. This is often more effective than trying to convey the same information in text.

A recorded video can also create a stronger emotional connection. Seeing and hearing the seller’s voice and face can build trust and relationships faster than pure text
communication. It can also give the seller more credibility. A professionally recorded video with a personal message shows that the seller is
committed and has invested time and resources in communicating their message effectively.

Today, there are several AI-based tools that can simplify the process of recording, customizing
and distributing more personalized and engaging video messages.

Covideo is an example of a video messaging platform designed for both sales and marketing teams. It allows a salesperson to quickly and easily include a personalized video greeting in emails. Covideo’s AI features include  transcribing videos into text, making them searchable and easier
to navigate. The user can also include various
call-to-action buttons in the video to encourage the recipient to take specific actions, such as downloading an e-book, reading a case study, attending a webinar or scheduling a meeting.

Vidyard is another  AI solution that makes it easy to record and share personalized videos with just a few clicks. The recordings are made with your webcam and you can also record your screen
if you want to show a presentation or make a demo at the same time. You then share the video by email, text message or on social media. The

analytics tool also lets you keep track of which videos are engaging so you can follow up at the right time and with the right message.

A final option worth mentioning is Dubb. Dubb focuses on making sales and communication videos personal and engaging. The platform has features that allow users to create personalized

video greetings, distribute them via email and SMS, and automatically send follow-up messages after the recipient has watched the video.

All of these tools can also be integrated with CRM systems such as Salesforce, Hubspot and Marketo as part of the sales process.

2.7 AI-DRIVEN MEETING
BOOKING AND SCHEDULING


Before automated solutions became commonplace, many salespeople spent significant time manually booking meetings. This meant they had to communicate back and forth with potential customers  by email or phone to find common meeting times, which could be very time-consuming.

With the introduction of automated appointment scheduling tools and AI-supported meeting management, salespeople have been able
to reduce the amount of time they spend on administrative tasks such as booking meetings, managing calendars, and responding to emails. These tools can automate the process and make it more efficient.

Let’s look at some examples. x.ai offers automated meeting booking using advanced AI. Salespeople can link their calendar to x.ai and then copy the x.ai assistant into their emails when they want to schedule meetings with customers or prospects. The assistant manages all communication and coordinates appointments between all parties. This saves the seller’s time and minimizes the risk of double bookings.

Clara Labs and Meetfox work in a similar way. Clara acts as an AI-based virtual assistant that books appointments for the salesperson. When the customer is emailed,  the seller includes his assistant “Clara” with a cc who then takes over the appointment booking. Clara handles the details, creates the invitations, coordinates with
everyone who will attend the meeting and follows up as needed. In addition,  it can take into account the preferences and requirements indicated by the seller.

MeetFox offers more than just booking meetings. The platform uses AI to suggest optimal meeting times that take into account time zones and
users’ calendars. In addition, vendors can use

Introduction
3.1 FROM PRODUCT FOCUS
TO CUSTOMER VALUE ORIENTATION









“Customers can have a car painted any color they want, as long as it is black.”








It is said that Henry Ford  once coined the phrase, “Customers can have a car painted any color they want, as long as it is black.” Whether he expressed himself that way is unclear, as the first model
was not even produced in black. Whether he expressed himself that way is unclear, as the first model was not even produced in black.

But the quote, which became a symbol of
the momentum of the industrial revolution  in the early 20th century, also took on another meaning that many business leaders followed for most of the 20th century. Value was created through efficient manufacturing and
production rather than effective customer value orientation.  This product-oriented approach has changed drastically over time. With increasing competition, the focus is now on the customer. In everything. Especially when it comes to sales.

A simple description of this development is to say that we have moved from communicating customer value to creating customer value. What does this mean? Well, if a seller has historically been good at communicating the benefits of
their products, services or solutions by showing the savings, profits or other benefits, that is
no longer enough. In an AI-driven  world with new customer expectations, the salesperson must also be part of value creation through the insights, knowledge or creative ideas they bring




to the customer. The salesperson thus becomes a consultant, advisor and business developer who not only communicates, but also creates value for the customer.

A number of studies carried out by Mercuri
International show that this trend is true. In
‘The Future State of Sales’ survey - in which Mercuri International interviewed over 1,000 commercial managers - 85% of respondents ranked ‘customer value orientation’ as the most important trend of all. 5

It also revealed some other interesting conclusions. What exactly do buyers perceive as “customer  value” when interacting with a seller?  In other words, what does a salesperson
do that is perceived as creating customer value? The results showed the following factors in descending order:



Being proactive and listening to the

These conclusions are also confirmed by other studies. According to a LinkedIn survey, over three quarters (82%) of top salespeople say they “always research potential customers before making contact or setting up a meeting”.6 This
compares to only 49% for other sellers. Successful salespeople are thus more informed and knowledgeable than their peers.

Despite this fact, few buyers feel that sellers
live up to these expectations. For example, only
37% of all buyers  feel that the salespeople they meet understand and can deliver insights about their industry. Furthermore, only 33% feel that salespeople are well informed, while only 27% find that salespeople can draw conclusions from the data they have about their business. 7

In other words, there is more to be desired here. And this is where we get into AI. AI has the potential to dramatically change these numbers by allowing salespeople to collect and analyze data about their customers  so they can be more

In an AI-driven  world with new
   customer expectations, the salesperson must also be part of value creation through the insights, knowledge or creative
   ideas they bring to the customer. The salesperson thus becomes a consultant, advisor and business developer who not only communicates, but also creates value for the customer.



3.2 AI: CUSTOMER VALUE BASED
ON TRENDS AND RESEARCH


Salespeople who are perceived as creating
value are thus good at delivering insights to their customers. They educate, they inspire and they challenge their customers based on the knowledge they possess. As mentioned above, they also add value by guiding the customer into the future by providing advice, inspiration and knowledge of what’s around the corner.

Imagine a salesperson offering selection and recruitment services for salespeople and sales managers. Wouldn’t it be valuable if he or she could provide advice and insights based on trends and research on what skills are in demand or what requirements will be placed on the salespeople of the future?

For example, what is the impact of the AI developments highlighted in this report on the recruitment of salespeople? A salesperson who can provide advice, tips and insights on this is likely to create an enhanced perceived customer value by becoming the unique value, beyond the specific offer.


How can a salesperson monitor and analyze trends or gather research-based insights that can be used
in dialogue with potential customers? To begin with, we note that this is primarily an organizational issue. This means that the company must set a strategy and

allocate resources to make this feasible and continuously provide and train its salespeople in relevant skills.



There are certainly easier things a seller can do on their own. For example, ChatGPT can act as a sounding board for the vendor, suggesting trends and research relevant to a particular area. However, it should be remembered that ChatGPT’s data is not 100% current, which may limit its knowledge.

However, for those who want to monitor and capture relevant trends in real time, there are more advanced platforms. These AI-powered trend analysis platforms use machine learning to identify and analyze historical data along with current events to predict and identify different types of trends.

A well-known and popular tool for this is Google Trends, which analyzes billions of searches every day to discover new trends and assess how they might evolve over time.

For those who want to broaden their horizon and collect data from more sources, such as news articles, social media, patents and research reports, ITONICS Trend Scouting may be a better option. This platform combines automated data collection with AI-driven analysis and expert judgment
to produce more industry-specific trends that can be used to make more informed business decisions. Search results can thus be filtered by sectors such as aerospace, automotive, banking and finance, chemicals, energy, food, health and pharmaceuticals, IT, retail and more.




An additional option is explodingtopics.com, which uses AI to analyze millions of searches, conversations and mentions across the internet to identify trends at an early stage. This tool is aimed more at entrepreneurs and developers who want to get new ideas before anyone else.

For those who want to gain research-based insights to add value to the customer, there are solutions for that too. For example, Consensus

uses AI to find answers in academic research reports ranging from biology to social sciences. You simply ask a question  and then get conclusions from any relevant research.

3.3 AI: CUSTOMER VALUE
BASED ON INSIGHT INTO THE CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS

Understanding the customer’s industry, business and long-term ambitions  is also a critical factor
for any salesperson who wants to be perceived as creating value. No customer or decision-maker has the desire or commitment to spend time
in unnecessary meetings that don’t give them anything. Thus, sellers need to find out as much as possible about the customer that is relevant.

This may involve understanding the customer’s current situation, challenges and needs, financial health or goals and growth plans to help them improve their business.

In the best of worlds, the salesperson already has some knowledge of the customer at this point.  It can be knowledge based on data from the CRM system, from the market or customer analysis performed beforehand, data from the ideal customer description or the customer’s website, or from colleagues with insight from previous business relationships. Maybe the
data has been obtained from a chatbot that had the initial conversation via the website and has already asked the potential customer a number of questions about their needs, challenges
and wishes, analyzed the answers and made recommendations that you can now build on in the customer meeting.

Again, ChatGPT can act as a sounding board and advisor to answer questions you have about a particular company, its market or products. However, other solutions based on the same technology may be more advantageous. For example, with Baron you can use ChatGPT  in all
your applications whether you use Slack, Chrome,
Gmail, Word or Excel etc. It also provides a special application for sales professionals that helps

you find all kinds of information such as a client company’s business, its competitors or the contact details of its decision-makers.

There are also several more niche AI tools that generate data about customers’ businesses.


These so-called ‘sales intelligence platforms’ draw data from a variety  of sources to enrich the CRM system with information about decision makers and companies.



Examples of such solutions are Affinity and Demandbase. Both can be integrated with systems such as Salesforce and Dynamics 365 where they complete each contact and company record with information on key decision makers, their position and background, the company’s turnover, profitability, growth, the markets they operate in, how they are financed or their financial situation.

This data can also be complemented by the personality profiles of the decision-makers. Crystal Knows collects data from thousands of online sources to find information about a particular person, what is written about them, what they
write, and the digital footprints they have left on social media. Based on this information, Crystal Knows makes a personality assessment.




For a salesperson, this means an increased opportunity to adapt their selling style based on whether the customer is, for example, dominant, analytical, skeptical or outgoing. The tool, which is also integrated with LinkedIn, also suggests how the salesperson should prepare, argue, negotiate, behave and much more to build trust with their counterpart.


Another solution for
gaining deeper insights into customers is to use web scraping. It involves using an AI-based computer program to navigate and collect information from different web pages, analyzing their content and extracting specific data according to predetermined



Such tools can play an insights into what is existing customers.

One such tool is Oct automatically helps and analyze data in a areas. For a sales
this may involve monit collecting and analyzing customers’ press releases, company news, news articles, newsletters,
and websites, but also what is written about the customer in the media,
in order to
draw important conclusions.

This information can also be complemented by more detailed analysis. Why not get insights from the customer’s latest annual report? If it is available as a pdf, you can upload it to askyourpdf.com and ask all kinds of questions about the content. For other file formats such as doc, e-pub, txt or website, you can use chatdoc. With this, you can ask anything and get easy-to- understand  answers within seconds.

While the solutions mentioned above can be very useful in the important work of learning about
the customer to add value, there are even greater opportunities with AI. This is because AI opens
the door to much more proactive sales. In short, it is about being able to predict the future needs of your customers and offer solutions before they even realize they need it.

Take an example.



Let’s say you work as a salesperson in a company that sells all kinds of agricultural products to farmers8. You realize that if you could access information on weather conditions, crop yields, plant physiology and soil conditions, you could help your customers make better decisions and optimize their operations using your products. So, you want this information to help you do a better job and create value for your customer.

Now it’s time to think about where you can find this information and how you can use AI
to analyze it. You don’t need to think about the technology behind AI, but you do need to know what tools are available and which companies or organizations could provide this information.

In this case, you discover that there is a company that collects data on weather conditions and climate change specifically designed for farmers. This is done using meteorological satellites, radar and weather stations. You also discover that the Swedish Board of Agriculture uses drones that fly over the fields to collect data on soil topography, moisture, plant cover and pests. Finally, you find out that John Deere provides tractors equipped with sensors that collect real-time data on all
its machines. These are routes, positioning, fuel consumption, machine status but also data on weather, soil and plants. These three actors thus collect millions of different data points from various sources that can be of great value to a farmer.

What if you could now access this data and use AI to analyze and identify patterns and trends that can help your customer make better decisions? Such an analysis would be at a level that a human being is nowhere near capable of.

Now imagine that you are going to contact a potential customer who could benefit from this information. The classic way would be to call and say:

“Hi Bill, my name  is X and I’m from this company, let’s make an appointment so you can tell me about your farm!”.

Equipped with AI, the seller can now instead call up and say:

“Hi Bill, let me tell you about your farm. Last season, your soybean harvest was reduced by
20%. I know, the rain ruined a lot. But it is not only that. According to our data, soil conditions have changed, resulting in several new pests becoming established. That’s why you were late in planting  this year. We now also see that the harvest you planned for October will be delayed until at
least November. This means  that your return will be around 93%, not 97% as you expected. However, I have a solution to this. To reach your desired yield, you will need to add a special plant protection product adapted to your crops. Given your soil conditions, you will also need to add a different fertilizer than the one you have now. This work should start now in August.”

“By the way, two of your three combines will need to be replaced within three years. With the increase in output prices, you can reduce your interest costs by 1 percentage point if you tie up your loans now. You will make  a saving  of around
€50,000 on this”.

“I will be happy to tell you more about this when we meet. What does Thursday look like this week?”.





8 The example is inspired by an interview with Jim Dickie and Barry Trailer in “The Sama Podcast “: https://podcast. strategicaccounts.org/yes-artificial-intelligence-ai-can-help-sams-co-create-value-with-their-customers-with- jim-dickie-and-barry-trailer/




So sales organizations with specialist AI skills can gain a huge advantage over their competitors.
In all likelihood, we can therefore expect that
the sales organizations of the future  will not only interact with marketing, they will also need to collaborate with IT and data departments. With AI, the IT department can analyze lots of data.
It can do more analysis in a second than a single

human would do in a year. That is its strength. Now imagine that we now add the power of the human element: salespeople who advise, build trust, demonstrate judgment, creativity,
collaboration and responsiveness. The power of this combination of creating value for both the customer and the company is fascinating.

3.4 AI: CUSTOMER VALUE BASED
ON COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS


With increased transparency and new technological tools, it has become easier for buyers to gather information and compare different suppliers. It also means that salespeople and sales organizations need to understand what competitors are doing in order to offer customers added value. By carefully studying and analyzing
the competition, sellers can increase their ability to create value for their customers in several ways.H

One of the most crucial aspects of competitive analysis is the ability to create tailor-made solutions for customers. By understanding what other players in the market offer, the seller can adapt their products or services to better meet the customer’s needs. This results in unique
solutions that competitors cannot match, thereby differentiating the vendor and creating value by increasing customer efficiency and profitability.

Another important benefit of competitive analysis is that it provides a basis for pricing products
or services correctly. By understanding how competitors price their offerings, the seller can develop a competitive pricing strategy. It may also be possible to create added value that exceeds the price difference, thus convincing the customer to choose the seller’s offer.

Furthermore, competitive analysis can help the seller to identify weaknesses or gaps in competitors’ offerings. By offering solutions that directly address these deficiencies, the vendor can create greater perceived customer value while highlighting their own strengths.

Competitive analysis can also serve as a source of knowledge and expertise for customers. By informing the customer about market trends, best practices and the latest innovations, the vendor can increase customer trust and position itself as a reliable partner.

Today, there are many AI-based tools that can help you analyze competitor data. One example is browse.ai. Using this tool, you can easily extract information from your competitors’ websites to keep you updated on their products, marketing campaigns and web presence.

Crayon is another AI-powered platform that allows you to track and analyze your competitors’ digital footprint, including pricing, product updates, marketing campaigns, and market reputation. The information can help sellers identify competitive advantages, ways to differentiate themselves, adjust prices and adapt their sales strategy. It can also be used to produce “battlecards” that are automatically updated in real time.

Similarly, Kompyte uses AI to track and analyze competitors’ digital marketing strategies. The platform provides real-time updates and reports on changes in competitors’ activities on the web, social media and ad campaigns.

You can also use AI to gain insights into competitors’ web traffic, visitor behavior, customer engagement, and keyword strategies. Two valuable tools for this purpose are SimilarWeb and SEMrush. Type in your competitors’ web domain and in seconds you’ll have plenty of statistics to compare yourself with.

3.5 COLLECT DATA TO HELP
YOU SOLVE YOUR CUSTOMER’S PROBLEMS





“If I had one hour to solve
a problem and my life depended on it, I would spend the first 55 minutes defining the problem and the last five minutes solving it.”

Albert Einstein





Sales is about solving customers’ problems and helping them to be more successful. But to do that, we also need to define what the problem
is. As Einstein suggested, this is what takes time. The solution is simple if we have done a thorough analysis and identification of the problem. In this section, we have therefore given some examples of how to obtain data on customers in order to identify their problems, challenges and needs, which in turn allows the seller to be proactive and provide good advice and solutions to these problems.

So the key to identifying problems is access to data. As in the case of the farmer, the seller was able to identify different ways to collect data and analyze it with AI, making the solution very simple but adding great value to the customer.

The salespeople and sales organizations of the future must therefore become more data-driven

and always ask the question: “what data do I need about my customers and their businesses that we can analyze to add customer value and solve their problems?”.

The first step is not to think about where this
data will come from or how AI works. It is first and foremost about becoming aware of what kind of information is important to do a good job with the customer. Then you can actively start thinking about whether there is an actor providing this data and how to analyze it. Maybe there are already people or companies that have access to this data? Alternatively, you can get it on your own with the help of your IT department, for example. As long
as we have access to data, AI will always be able to draw conclusions and see patterns in it.

Introduction
4.1 THE EMERGENCE OF
VIRTUAL SALES


Virtual selling, also known as remote selling, is a sales method in which sellers and customers interact without physically meeting. Instead, various digital and technological tools, such
as video conferencing, are used to build and maintain customer relationships. From a historical perspective, this is nothing  new; the digital
era has been going on for over two decades. However, with the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020, this method has become the new normal, with virtually all B2B sellers more or less forced to use virtual selling. Gartner goes so far as to predict that 80 percent of all B2B sales interactions will take place through digital channels by 2025. 9

There are three main driving forces behind this development:

1	First, customers’ expectations and buying behavior have changed. For example, a McKinsey survey shows that between 70-80% of all B2B decision- makers now prefer to interact remotely rather than face-to-face. 10 Buyers
have simply changed their preferences. The video calls that replace physical meetings are perceived as
time-saving, easier to schedule and more productive.

2 	Second, suppliers can make significant cost savings in terms of reduced travel costs but also more efficient use of the vendor’s time.




9https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/trends/future-of-sales
10 Mckinsey (Oct 2020). These eight charts show how COVID-19 has changed B2B sales forever.




3 	Third, rapid technological developments have given us several new and improved tools to communicate and interact with customers remotely.

Despite the benefits that come with virtual selling, there are also several challenges. According to Mercuri International’s survey “The Future State of Trust”, the shift to more
digital customer interactions has led to increased difficulties in building trust and personal relationships with customers. 11 The main reason
is that virtual meetings usually have less room for informal relationship-building conversations, but also because it is more difficult to perceive subtle signals, such as facial expressions, gestures and eye contact, which are important for building trust.



This is reflected in the fact that 68% of managers surveyed believe that the ability to navigate this digital reality is crucial to remain competitive. 12

Additional challenges include difficulties in getting the buyer’s attention and maintaining their engagement during virtual meetings. These challenges have the potential to reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of distance-based sales interactions.

Although these challenges are difficult to overcome, new technologies based on AI can help with many of them. For example, with AI, we can now record, transcribe and analyze virtual sales calls to better understand what works and what doesn’t. This can involve understanding
and analyzing the seller’s behavior, as well as interpreting and analyzing what customers say, which can help us see patterns in their needs, preferences and behaviors. Here, Gartner

predicts that at least 70 percent of all B2B interactions between sellers and buyers will be recorded and analyzed by 2025. 13

With new AI features such as AI-driven coaching and real-time feedback, improved audio and video quality, emotional  analysis, language understanding and translation, and eye contact correction, the salesperson can also create an improved customer experience and increase buyer attention and engagement.

In this section, we provide concrete examples of how AI can be used to optimize the sales process in a virtual context and what concrete benefits this can bring to sales organizations.

4.2 AI-DRIVEN RECORDING,
TRANSCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS OF SALES CALLS

A major advantage of the increasing number of digital meetings with potential and existing customers is that these meetings generate a large amount of data. Data that AI can analyze to extract valuable insights into what works, what doesn’t, and what can be improved.


This type of conversational intelligence is particularly valuable in a profession
like sales because it can help us see patterns in human conversations that we humans cannot see or understand ourselves.



This can involve understanding and analyzing the seller’s behavior, as well as interpreting and analyzing what customers say, which can help us see patterns in their needs, preferences and behaviors.

There are many different AI-based solutions for this purpose, but most of them have similar functions based on recording and transcribing the conversation (transferring sound and speech to text), analyzing the information and then making summaries on what can be improved or developed.

Examples of such tools are Fireflies, Sembly,
Grain, Otter and Attention. All these solutions

can be used to transcribe video calls, take meeting notes and draw conclusions from your professional meetings. Even tl;dv may be worth mentioning. For a salesperson, these tools can be of great importance as they can fully concentrate on the conversation, not on taking notes. They integrate easily with video conferencing solutions such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams. Some, like Fireflies and Attention, can also integrate with CRM systems like Salesforce to automatically
save notes from meetings.

Waitroom is another  solution but handles meeting recordings a little differently. Instead of simply summarizing conversations in text, it transforms meeting recordings into easy-to- navigate, dynamic video clips broken down
by each participant and topic that can also be distributed by email to participants afterwards.

A further step in this development is to use AI to analyze the emotional state of the customer, known as emotional AI. Although it is currently possible to use this technology in virtual video meetings, there are some limitations.  It must respect the privacy and consent of the recipient, as not everyone is keen on being analyzed in minute detail.

However, the technology itself is fascinating,  as it is based on advanced algorithms that use voice and facial recognition to analyze and interpret human emotions. Let’s say you have a video meeting with a potential customer. With a camera turned on, AI can now detect and analyze thousands of data points on the recipient’s face based on the movements of the facial muscles. Is the customer happy? Angry? Surprised? Sorry? Contemptuous?




In addition,  if we allow the AI to analyze the customer’s voice and tone, such as pitch, tempo, loudness, intonation, rhythm and word choice, a complete picture of the customer’s
emotional state can be provided. For a seller, this can obviously be of great  value. If a customer seems frustrated or confused, the salesperson can quickly adjust their approach to alleviate these feelings and provide a better customer experience.

One of the leading companies in this field is MorphCast. Their solution is based on a plugin that incorporates emotional AI into Zoom conferences, video meetings, webinars or
product demonstrations. The aim is to take virtual meetings to a whole new level of interaction
and engagement. Using facial recognition

and advanced AI algorithms, MorphCast interprets and analyzes all participants’ facial expressions in real time. This kind of insight can help the host adjust their content to change the emotional state of the participant and increase engagement.

Affectiva  is another  innovative player. However, they use emotional AI for other purposes.
These include  media analysis, which measures customers’ emotional expressions when watching a commercial, trailer or movie.  In practice, it
can determine in advance whether a video will engage or not, which says something about the accuracy of future customer communication.

4.3 AI-DRIVEN FEEDBACK
AND SALES COACHING


To succeed in sales regular coaching and feedback is critical. This has been established by Mercuri International in a research  project on effective selling in which over 6,000 salespeople were interviewed. 14 The difference in the annual growth rate of companies that do this compared to those that do not is as high as 10%.

However, coaching your salespeople and providing constructive feedback can be challenging for several reasons. One of the biggest challenges is that we humans are driven by emotions. Accepting criticism, even if it is constructive and well- intentioned, can therefore be difficult. People can become defensive or emotionally affected, which can make communication difficult.

Another challenge of giving constructive feedback is that it also requires good communication skills. The coach must be able to express their feedback in a clear and direct way, while showing empathy and understanding. It is often about finding the right balance between honesty and kindness, which can be difficult, especially  in sensitive situations.

appraisals, salespeople can receive immediate feedback on their performance and behavior, allowing salespeople to quickly adjust their performance and behavior.

AI-powered sales coaching can also help create a more supportive and engaging environment for salespeople. By giving salespeople access to insights and feedback tailored to their needs, AI
can help boost their confidence, motivate them to improve their skills and make them more engaged in their work, while helping sales managers  or coaches become more objective in their coaching.

As with many other AI-based solutions, AI-powered sales coaching is based on collecting and analyzing large amounts of data. This can include data
from phone calls and emails, but perhaps most importantly digital video meetings.

However, these challenges may soon be a thing of the past. As more customer meetings take place virtually, the door has also opened for AI-driven coaching, which means that salespeople can now receive feedback, support and assistance based on facts and objective analysis, rather than on human subjective opinions, preferences or experiences.

Another advantage of AI-driven sales coaching is that it can be done in real time. Instead of waiting for quarterly performance reviews or annual

Today, there are several AI-based tools that can analyze and provide feedback on both visual and verbal communication skills. This can include giving feedback on visual elements such as facial expressions, body language, eye movements and
hand gestures, but also the ability to express oneself professionally, use the right kind of wording, speak clearly and keep a comfortable pace.

An example of a tool that can be used for this purpose is Gong. In addition to recording and transcribing sales calls so that a sales coach can follow up with personalized coaching interventions, it can also give the salesperson real-time feedback during the meeting. This can include identifying common objections and questions and suggesting arguments to deal with them, as well as providing automatic tips and reminders of what is being said. For example, salespeople have a tendency to talk too much and not let the customer speak.


According to Gong’s analysis of 25,000 sales calls, they now know that the highest performing salespeople talk an average of 43% during their sales calls and listen
57%. 15 This compares to low- performing salespeople who, on average, talk more than
60% of the time in customer interactions.

Based on this type of data, Gong can thus remind and provide real-time feedback to the salesperson when they are talking too much, which can help

them to immediately adjust their behavior and improve their performance.

Another rapidly growing solution is Chorus. It acts as a virtual coach that helps salespeople analyze and improve their sales calls. Like Gong, it answers questions such as: Is the salesperson  talking too fast? Or too much? Does the seller interrupt the customer when they are talking? And what about emotional capacity?

Other solutions that enable salespeople to coach themselves in real time include  Yoodli, Poised, Demodesk and Allego. All of these help the salesperson to improve their communication
and presentation skills, including feedback on unnecessary filler words such as “eeh” and “hmm”, tempo, word choice and content. All to help the salesperson become a better storyteller and listener and speak with greater confidence and clarity.

Showpad also offers feedback and coaching solutions. With their AI-based solution PitchAI, salespeople can record their sales pitches and presentations as videos. This allows them to receive direct feedback from the AI-based coach or from
a manager, trainer or colleague. The feedback can include factors such as body language, tone of voice, clarity of message and other key communication aspects, allowing for improved sales presentations.

At a more general level, you can analyze which salespeople are performing best - and why. At a systemic level, these analyses can provide answers to questions such as how often the price should be mentioned, when in the conversation it is important to talk a lot and which counter-arguments are effective. The opportunity exists to discover successful - and replicable - keywords, phrases or behaviors that lead to closure.

4.4 AI-DRIVEN LANGUAGE
UNDERSTANDING AND TRANSLATION

In an increasingly globalized world, communication with customers  and colleagues who speak different languages is not uncommon. AI has become an invaluable resource for breaking language barriers and creating smooth communication regardless of language. For example, tools like Google Translate and DeepL have long been used to quickly and efficiently translate texts from one language to another.

But this is not only true for text. With today’s technology, we can also translate speech in real time from one language to another. This is known as “real-time speech translation” or “live speech translation”.

An example of this is Google Translate, which has a feature called “conversation mode” in its mobile phone app that allows users to have a two-way communication in different languages by translating speech in real time. Microsoft Teams also has this feature built into its solution. Currently,  it works by activating “live subtitles” and selecting the language spoken and the language you want it to be translated into. All meeting participants will now be able to read
live texts translated into their language, enabling more engaging, inclusive and productive video meetings.

It is important to note that AI-based real-time speech interpretation systems still have  their limitations and are not always perfect. These systems may have difficulties dealing with dialects, accents and different speech rates. But with the rapid development of AI technology, they are likely to become  more sophisticated. For example,  in the near future, translations will not be limited by speech-to-text translation

capabilities. They will also include real-time speech-to-speech translation capabilities.

An example of this is the AI-based video platform HeyGen, which launched its video translation feature in September 2023. This allows you to easily translate your voice in a video into another language. In practice, it clones your voice from
a video and translates  it into languages such
as English, Spanish, French, Chinese, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Hindi and Japanese. If that wasn’t  enough, it also synchronizes your lips to your new voice so it looks and sounds as realistic as possible.

The possibilities with this type of technology are of course endless. At the time of writing, music streaming service Spotify has just enabled

its podcasters to automatically translate their podcast episodes into alternative languages while retaining their own voices. This of course opens the door to a wider audience.

Not to mention video conferencing platforms like Microsoft Teams or Zoom. In the near future, AI will enable us to talk to each other in our own native languages. No dubbing, no subtitles, no voice distortion. Just people who sound and look the way they do when communicating.

4.5 AI TO IMPROVE IMAGE
AND SOUND QUALITY IN YOUR VIDEO MEETINGS

AI has not only become an indispensable resource for translating languages  or analyzing the content of your video meetings. AI can also improve the customer experience by creating
a crystal-clear image and sound quality, which

can be crucial to ensure your message is communicated clearly and professionally. This ability to adjust, correct and improve these aspects can be done in several ways:










Noise reduction:
AI-driven noise reduction is a technology that can filter out unwanted background noise. If you’re in a noisy
café or office, AI can identify your voice and prioritize it over surrounding sounds.
An example of a solution for this is Krisp. This AI-powered app can be used with popular video conferencing tools to remove background noise such as voices, barking dogs, babies crying, fan noise or keyboard clicks.

Light and background adjustment:
AI can analyze the lighting in your room and adjust the image quality to ensure you are optimally visible. If the light is too bright or dim, AI cameras can automatically adjust the exposure to maintain a balanced image. Examples of such tools
are the Lume Cube Video Conference Lighting Kit and the Elgato Key Light. Both of these use AI to analyze and adjust not only the lighting, but also the foreground and background. Once the AI has identified the background,
it replaces it with a virtual image or video. It can be anything from a peaceful beach scene to a branded office background.

Image stabilization: Shaky or jittery videos can be distracting. AI-based tools can detect and correct for this shakiness in real time. ManyCam is an easy-to-use virtual camera that offers a set of tools to improve the video quality of your video meetings. One of these includes image stabilization features to reduce shaking
in your video during video meetings.




As well as high quality video and audio to create a good customer experience in virtual meetings, it is also ideal to maintain eye contact with
your audience - even when you need to look at your notes or read a script from a screen or teleprompter.

With Captions and Nvidia Broadcast, this is now possible. In addition to offering a full suite of live streaming and video conferencing tools, these companies also offer AI features that automatically adjust your gaze to look into the eyes of the person you’re talking to.

For a salesperson who wants to record a video, give a product presentation to a customer, or organize a webinar, this solution can be very useful in improving the customer experience and enhancing professionalism.

By using these AI tools, you can ensure that your video meetings are professional, distinctive and disruption-free. This will help  you deliver your message effectively and create a more positive impression with your customers  and partners.

In 1987, the first version of Microsoft PowerPoint was released. Since then, PowerPoint’s market share among design and presentation software has grown rapidly, reaching a
peak market share of 95%.



Today, most people who have needed to present in an engaging way have tried this tool, especially salespeople. Properly managed, PowerPoint can help salespeople strengthen their oral communication with professional sales presentations that include visually appealing elements and text.

Despite  its market dominance - and even though Microsoft has in recent years developed PowerPoint to include  several AI features such as design recommendations, image recognition,
presentation feedback and automatic translation
- it is not the only tool on the market. With the rise of AI, many new players have challenged the giant and launched tools that are both simpler and cheaper. Some of them based on
PowerPoint, others built on their own platforms.

An example of an AI-based tool that helps you create visually appealing sales presentations in PowerPoint is Beautiful.ai. This solution offers a range of templates and design elements that can be customized to match your brand and message, and it also provides real-time feedback on design choices to help you make the best decisions.

Another solution is Presentations.ai, which uses AI to create customized slideshows from a simple text description. Similarly, Slides.ai
works by quickly and easily creating high-quality presentations and slideshows by choosing a topic for their presentation. The tool then automatically generates titles and discussion points for them before exporting your slides to Google Slides or PowerPoint.

Another exciting tool for creating engaging presentations is Gamma. This tool allows you to easily transform text into visual PowerPoint
presentations, documents or web pages. Write what you want your theme to be about and then let Gamma do the work for you by suggesting the structure, content, texts, headings and layout.
The result can also be adapted to your brand’s fonts and color coding.

If you want to try another  solution that is not based on PowerPoint, Canva is an option. With this free tool, you can choose from a wide range of templates, beautiful images and layouts
that will make  your work stand  out and impress customers. New images can also be created using text-to-image functions. Want to create the presentation in your company’s corporate colors? Just upload an image with those colors and then drag the image into your presentation.
Then when you add a text or color plate, the color suggestions from your uploaded image come up as suggestions so you don’t need to know your company’s color codes or look for similar colors.

To produce nice graphs or charts in Excel, which can then be imported into your presentation, there  is also an AI. With Rows, you can turn sprawling Excel sheets into beautifully designed charts and graphs.

5.3 AI-GENERATED
STORYTELLING


Since the beginning of time, people have gathered around the campfire to tell stories. This has met one of the most fundamental human needs: a sense of belonging, meaning and development.

Against this background, not much has changed
- our basic needs are the same as they were thousands of years ago. But conditions have changed. Today, we no longer gather around the campfire to teach each other about our origins or how to survive. Instead, stories have become an important part of communicating, engaging and influencing the people around us.

In business  terms, this is referred  to as
‘storytelling’. Basically, it’s about creating an emotional connection with the customer by using stories that resonate and inspire. Storytelling allows sellers to make products and services
more meaningful to customers. By using
stories, they can show how their offers can solve customers’ problems, improve their lives or their performance. It also provides an opportunity
to create a narrative that takes customers on a journey from problem to solution.

Stories also make information memorable and easy to understand. Instead of overwhelming customers  with technical details or features, salespeople can use stories to explain complex concepts in a simple and inspiring way.

The benefit of storytelling is huge. Studies show that salespeople who use storytelling in their presentations help them connect more deeply with their customers  and thus increase the likelihood of winning business.

However, storytelling can be difficult for several reasons. Creating an understandable, relevant and interesting story that feels authentic to the

5.4 AI-GENERATED CASE
STUDIES AND CUSTOMER REFERENCES

Case studies and testimonials can be very useful when presenting your solution or offer to a potential customer. While case studies provide deep insights into how the company’s products or services have actually solved specific problems or challenges for existing customers, customer references - in the form of positive reviews and recommendations
from existing customers - serve as a valuable social confirmation of the company’s ability to deliver and exceed expectations. This is particularly important in B2B sales, where decision-makers often look for evidence that a product or service can deliver the results they need.

Several studies also confirm this.


According to a survey by DemandGenReport, more than half of all B2B buyers (54%) engage in case studies as part of their buying process.16 Another study also claims that 73% of all B2B buyers consider case studies and customer references to be a key factor in their buying
decisions.17

At the same time, 78% of B2B buyers believe that the salespeople they meet have no relevant examples or case studies to share.18



Thus, at a time when customer trust is crucial to success, case studies and customer references are a powerful resource to enhance a company’s credibility and customers’ willingness to buy. A
common way of obtaining references is to start by identifying your best and most satisfied customers who you think would be willing to act as references. Then ask them if they would be interested in being a reference and explain why it would be important. This process may be suitable for companies with only a few major customers.

However, for those who have many customers, and in several different industries, it can be valuable
to automate this work so that the salesperson can use different types of references for different types of customers. This is where AI comes in. AI can
be used to identify the best reference customers by analyzing data on existing customers, their behavioral patterns, what they have bought and what they have rated in customer satisfaction surveys. Using this analysis, it can then suggest suitable customers who have had a positive experience with its products and services.

18 https://www.forrester.com/blogs/14-09-29-why_dont_buyers_want_to_meet_with_your_salespeople/




Additionally, AI can be used to automate the process of managing reference requests, making it easy for both marketing and sales teams to find references quickly, publish them on the website, on social media, or use them in tender proposals, sales presentations and customer meetings. An example of such an AI system is testimonial.to. With their tool, you start by creating  a dedicated landing page on your website. The link to the landing page can then be easily shared via email, social media or text message to customers asking
them to be a reference. The tool then does the rest. Send automatic reminders, collect text and record videos directly in the platform, without the need
for developers or video producers. Videos that can then be used in communication with customers.

Another, slightly more advanced, platform for managing customer references for B2B companies is Influitive. In short, it works as follows. In the first step, it uses AI to identify the best reference customers by analyzing their behavior, engagement and experience. With this analysis, they create segments of different potential references and then send personalized invitations to a community exclusive to reference customers. By joining this community, customers get access to exclusive content, different types of rewards and the opportunity to network with like-minded people.

In step two, Influitive uses a reward system to encourage and entice reference customers to participate in various activities, such as writing reviews, sharing success stories, attending events, and providing feedback on various products and services. By offering rewards and recognition for their efforts, the platform increases the motivation of reference customers to contribute to the company’s success.

The last step automates the management of collected references by matching them with potential customers with similar profiles and needs. The platform can be used by the sales team to
easily send references on demand but also to get quick access to the most relevant and compelling references for each potential customer.

5.5 SALES PRESENTATIONS
USING AR AND VR


Virtual Reality (VR) has its roots far back in history. In the 1960s and 1970s, researchers started experimenting with VR technology and created the first VR helmets with interactive simulators. But despite early progress, development has been slow, largely because the technology has been limited by quality and price challenges. The first breakthrough came
when Sony released PlayStation VR in 2016. With its launch, consumers could now explore and experience what it is like to be part of a virtual reality in different games.

At the same time, several different VR glasses were launched that suddenly gave us the opportunity to step into a filmed or computer- generated 3D environment and visit different parts of the world without even leaving the armchair. You could be chased by lifelike dinosaurs, ride roller coasters and wield fake swords. Those who wanted to climb Mount Everest could now do so from the safety of their living room, and those who wanted to get up
on stage next to Paul McCartney’s piano as he performed ‘Live and Let Die’ could also fulfil that wish.

The fact that VR is ideal for entertainment and gaming is obvious, and it’s easy to dismiss VR as a joke
or gimmick. But there are also great opportunities to use technology in marketing and sales. Gartner goes so far as to predict that 80 percent of all B2B sales interactions between suppliers and buyers
will take place in digital channels by 2025.19 In this

transformation, VR is expected to be an integral part of sales meetings, product demonstrations and training.

With VR glasses, a potential customer can study a product in detail and almost put the product
to work, understanding why it is the best choice. Interactive elements allow the customer to touch, feel, test and evaluate. It is like a combination of a trade  fair, customer visit and webinar in one.

The big advantage of VR is that it can provide a realistic feel and experience of complex products. Let’s say you sell cranes. Bringing a group of potential customers to the top of a crane may not always be practical or even desirable. Bringing
a crane to a sales meeting is an impossibility.

A flat 2D image on a website or in a catalog does not do the product justice. Instead, stakeholders with VR goggles can get a virtual tour of the interior with the possibility to also control a simulated crane. Solutions like these are used not only for demonstration purposes but also
for training. A journalist had heard about this opportunity to virtually operate a crane and asked to try it. After practicing crane lifting for
60 minutes in the simulator environment, he was placed in a real crane weighing 22 tons - and he could immediately start lifting containers as if he had never done anything else.

Those selling a complex service that may be difficult to demonstrate and explain can also benefit from VR. For example, Dell EMC created a virtual tour of its data centers where potential customers could get a glimpse of the data center and how data flows using the cloud. 20 You can dive into their cloud services, which are spread out like cloudlets in cheeky animations. You can twist and turn different components, follow data flows and bring up videos explaining security.
Experiences like these can help customers better relate to services and products and give them a deeper insight into the benefits they can provide.


A cousin of virtual reality
is augmented reality (AR). Similar to VR goggles, the user wears a kind of headset or smart glasses, but with the
difference that in this case the screen is semi-transparent.



In this augmented reality, information in the form of text or images is superimposed on the real world. It is therefore a combination of the real

world and other information graphically illustrated on top of it. Some call it the “hands of God” that miraculously appear, point, show and explain.

A term that has recently received a lot of attention and is often associated with virtual reality and augmented reality is Metaverse. The metaverse can be described as a virtual world
or digital ecosystem where users can interact with each other and with digital objects in real time. Facebook is probably the company that has received the most attention for its vision of creating an extended digital world that goes beyond the current social media platforms and offers users a whole new level of interaction, communication and collaboration. This world can include everything from virtual cities and
landscapes to games, social platforms, education, working environments and economy and trade. As a user, you can create a digital avatar that
looks and sounds like you. At the time of writing, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has just released a video where he meets and talks with AI researcher Lex Fridman in Facebook’s virtual world, with both of them dressed as avatars. The
feeling described is that they are both meeting in real life, despite being miles apart.

Whether and when this technology will be widely adopted remains to be seen. But for a sales organization that already wants to test VR and
AR in their sales meetings, there are solutions. With VirBELA and MeetingVr , suppliers can create virtual meeting rooms where customers and salespeople meet and interact in a virtual environment. Through these platforms, sellers can show their products in 3D, simulate usage scenarios and create a more physical feel of the products, regardless of the distance between the parties. Another solution is Microsoft’s HoloLens which, among other things, allows salespeople to let customers see and interact with the product
as if it were actually physically present, which is particularly useful for displaying complex or large products such as buildings, machines or vehicles.

10-22 from: https://venturebeat.com/2018/02/21/virtual-reality-is-poised-for-big-business-to-business-sales/




In the fierce competition for customers’ attention, early adopters of VR and AR can create alternative ways to attract customers. Once they are wearing the VR or AR glasses, you will have  their full attention and a great opportunity to take them
on an emotional journey. Further enhancing the realism is the ability to interact with the environment. A range of complementary products are emerging to manipulate objects and control environments. A next step towards gloves or
rings is logical,  as is being able to control directly

with just your hands. If you can get customers to engage more senses such as sight, hearing, touch and perhaps even smell, the impact can be even deeper with more lasting impressions. It’s about creating an emotional response to complement the usual (more rational) explanation of why you should buy something.

Introduction
6.1 WINNING THE DEAL


We have now gone through a number of different steps in the sales process and given examples
of where and how AI can be useful.  It is now time to get to the finish line and close the deal. This final phase, usually referred  to as the ‘win’ phase, aims to ensure that all details are in place and both seller and buyer agree on the terms and conditions before the product or service
is delivered to the customer. Here are some examples of what this might include:

review of the contract to ensure that it meets all legal requirements and does not violate any company policies.

4       Signing of the contract:
The customer officially accepts the contract and agrees to complete the purchase. Sometimes this requires approval from several decision-makers within the customer’s organization.

6.2 AI-DRIVEN NEGOTIATION
AND PRICE OPTIMIZATION


Imagine you are facing a crucial negotiation with a potential client. You know that the customer needs your products and services and that your solution can create value for the customer. You also know that it would be a clear advantage if you had differentiated your solution so that you were the only option left for the customer. But competition is fierce. You are not the only player. The customer has you and two other companies to choose from. At the same time, you know
that the customer is a tough negotiator, has a budget and is looking for the best possible deal. You now have a critical decision to make: What price should you offer to secure the deal without sacrificing the company’s profitability?

This is where AI-driven price optimization comes in and becomes your best friend in complex negotiation situations. Price optimization is about determining the optimal price for a product or service based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s needs, the customer’s turnover, the number of products or services, the value of the solution, competition, past wins and losses, costs and company objectives. Making this calculation manually is often a complicated, expensive and time-consuming process.

In this case, the seller could use AI-based price optimization tools such as Price f/x, Zilliant or Vendavo to secure the deal with the customer. All these calculate the optimal price and generate proposals for different pricing options that the seller can use as a basis for negotiation with the customer. In simple terms, it goes like this:


1        Data  collection:

The tool’s algorithms collect data on the customer’s past buying behavior, including previous prices they have accepted and rejected, product

preferences, and previous negotiated agreements. It also collects data on competitors’ pricing, costs to produce or deliver the product or service, and the company’s desired margin.


2      Factors and weighting:

The algorithm determines which factors are most relevant for determining the price in the specific situation. These factors may include the customer’s budget, previous business relationships, product differentiators, the competitive situation and the company’s profitability goals. Each factor is assigned a weighting based on its importance.


3      Price elasticity:

The algorithm uses price elasticity, which measures how sensitive customers are to price changes, to predict how a change
in price  will affect customer demand. For example, it can calculate how much a 5% price increase will affect the volume of sales.


4      Pricing options:

With all this data and weighting, the tool can use an algorithm to calculate the optimal price from a number of different pricing options that both meet the company’s profitability goals and increase the chances of winning the deal.

As always with this type of analysis, the tools must have access to data. The more and better




the data, the better the analysis. For example, systems need to access data on past transactions, including prices, quantities and the customers or segments involved, as well as data on production or delivery costs, including raw material costs, labor and overhead. This data must be provided by the company itself. Systems also need data
on competitors’ pricing and products and other market data such as inflation, exchange rates and other macroeconomic factors that can affect pricing. As this data can in many cases be

obtained from public databases, the systems themselves can provide this type of information.

But properly managed, and with the right data, these price optimization tools can help salespeople make data-driven decisions in negotiation situations and create deals that benefit both the company and its customers.

6.3 AI-GENERATED QUOTES
AND TENDER PROPOSALS


Every day, millions
of quotes and tender proposals are generated worldwide. The time it takes to develop these varies greatly depending on the complexity of the business and the solution.



In extreme cases it can take years or months
- in other cases a minute (if it is a standardized product). But overall, the effort and cost of this work is enormous.

The difference between a quote and a proposal may seem subtle, but in simple terms, a quote focuses mainly on providing a detailed picture of the price of a product or service and its quantity, while a proposal provides an in-depth description of a proposed solution to the customer’s problem or need. It includes pricing information, but

proposals (RFPs), a variety of AI-based tools have emerged in recent years that can, in many cases, minimize time spent while eliminating human error.

There are a large number of CPQ systems on the market today for generating quotes. CPQ stands for Configure-Price-Quote and means trying
to automate the whole process of generating
quotes, from configuring products and services according to customer needs to determining the right price and generating accurate and customized quotes. These systems often use
AI to take advantage of historical data and pricing models to suggest optimal prices and configurations for the quote.

Major CRM providers like Salesforce and Oracle have CPQ tools built into their platforms. For those who do not have access to these, there are solutions such as PROS Smart CPQ, Dealhub and Configure One. All of these use AI to
help salespeople quickly configure products, set prices, and generate customized quotes. According to McKinsey, companies that take advantage of such tools can streamline their bidding process and reduce the time to produce
21
usually also a presentation of the company, an analysis of the customer’s problem, a detailed plan of how the problem will be solved and a description of previous successful projects with references. Thus, tender proposals are more common in complex transactions where many variables are involved.

In order to streamline and facilitate the process of generating quotes and tender proposals, but also reading and analyzing customers’ requests for

a quote from three weeks to two hours.

To generate tender proposals that go beyond price and product, there are also AI-based solutions. With Hyperwrite, an AI-based writing assistant, you can also generate comprehensive tender proposals. To do this, enter the customer’s company name and provide a short description
or overview of the proposal you want to create. Click the “Generate” button and the AI will create a detailed business proposal based on your input.


21 https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/sales-automation-the-key- to-boosting-revenue-and-reducing-costs




You can then review the generated proposal and make the necessary changes or adjustments
to ensure it is consistent with your intended message and style. Copy and paste the proposal into your preferred document format.

Another solution is Pitchpower. Start by entering the link to your company’s website. The AI engine then retrieves data and compiles a text about your business and the products or services you offer. Then click on the services you want your company to offer in the proposal.

Storydoc also designs an interactive presentation for you. Enter the link to your website, or manually fill in information about your company, add the company logo, enter your industry, choose a design and edit as needed. Ready to send to customer!

In addition to helping you write quotes and tender proposals, AI can also help you interpret, analyze and respond to complex and extensive customer requests for proposals (RFPs).




Let’s illustrate this with an example:

Imagine you work as a salesperson in a technology company. You have now received a request for proposal (RFP) from a potential customer. The document is extensive, complex and full of detailed requirements and specifications. You realize that it will take a lot of time to go through it to answer all the questions.

Fortunately, your manager has purchased an RFP automation tool called Loopio that will now help you respond to the request faster and better. You upload the document to the software, which immediately starts scanning the content and extracts important information, including requirements, questions and specifications formulated by the customer. It helps  you understand what the customer is looking for.

The software now automatically compares the extracted requirements with previous responses your company has used in similar RFPs and suggests a number of matches.

You now review the proposed answers and use them as a basis for creating tailored answers to suit your client’s specific needs. You also provide additional information and answers to questions that the software could not answer.

After a few rounds of editing, you are satisfied with the tailored answers. With the software, you now create a professional document layout, including the company logo and graphic elements, to ensure that the tender proposal is not only accurate in content, but also well presented.

Finally, you use the software to deliver the RFP responses to the client in the right format and within the desired timeframe. When you are done, you will realize  that you have reduced the time spent by two thirds, while the quality of your answer has improved even more.



In conclusion, AI-based solutions for responding to requests for proposals and creating quotes and proposals can have a significant impact on a

seller’s efficiency. It is therefore likely that more companies will benefit from them in the future.

6.4 AI TO REVIEW LEGAL
CONTRACTS


Imagine that you worked for several months to secure an important deal with a large company.
All details have been discussed, prices negotiated and solutions adapted to the customer’s needs


Now, in the final stages
of the deal, the customer has sent a comprehensive legal agreement with lots of clauses, technical terms, conditions and contractual
texts. What should you do?



Just as AI can analyze and review complex tenders, AI can also review complex legal contracts. This AI is often trained on billions of lines of legal text and can therefore interpret text significantly faster and better than a human. In this case, you could therefore use solutions such as LegalSifter, Genie AI or Kira.

The process for using AI in legal contract review could look like this: Upload the legal agreement to the cloud-based solution and ask for a thorough review. The AI-based software then analyzes the document, extracts the relevant clauses, points out potential risk factors and compares them with the company’s internal guidelines, policies and specific needs. The result is an overview, with the main conclusions and recommendations.

In this fictional case, the software identified some critical areas of the contract where the customer’s requirements were not in line with company policy: The customer had demanded

discounts or benefits that the company does not normally offer under its pricing policy. Moreover, they had included  limitations of liability that the company was not prepared to accept under its guidelines. Finally, the software discovered that the customer’s requirements for delivery times or deadlines were more stringent than the company can normally meet. It was therefore important to rectify these issues before the agreement could be signed.

Based on this analysis, the seller can now consult with the company’s legal team to propose changes to the contract. This cooperation allows for a fast and efficient process to bring the contract in line with the company’s requirements while meeting the customer’s needs.

6.5 AI-DRIVEN CONTRACT
SIGNING


Not long ago, the process of sending contracts to customers and getting them to sign physical papers was a laborious and time-consuming task. Vendors  had to send documents by mail or fax and wait for customers to return the
signed contracts. This not only delayed business transactions but was also inefficient and environmentally unsustainable.

E-signing of contracts has therefore become increasingly popular. E-signatures are digital signatures that allow customers to easily sign contracts and documents online. This technology has gained enormous popularity, especially after the Covid-19 outbreak, when the number of companies using e-signatures increased by over
50%. 22

E-signing has many advantages. First, it is extremely convenient. Customers can sign documents from any location and at any time, saving time and reducing the need for physical presence. By some estimates, companies can save as much as $36 per contract sent to a customer. 23

Second, and most importantly, e-signing is a major step towards reducing paper consumption and thus preventing negative environmental impacts. But one of the most critical aspects of
e-signing is that it reduces the risk of document forgery and other forms of fraud. As e-signatures are cryptographically secure and can be traced back to the user, the risk of contracts being altered or forged after they have been signed is reduced.

Against this background, AI has become very important. The market today offers a variety of solutions that integrate AI to make the process even more efficient and safe. Examples of such solutions include DocuSign, Adobe Sign and SignNow. These tools use AI to automate the flow of contracts, verify users’ identities, detect any irregularities and ensure the security of the signed documents.

In summary, using AI for e-signing in business can save time, increase efficiency, improve customer experience and increase security. It is a technology that can be very valuable for

companies that want to improve their business processes and strengthen their competitiveness in the market.

6.6 AI-DRIVEN ORDER
MANAGEMENT AND INVOICING

Once the deal is won and the contract signed (in addition to delivering the product or service) it is time to invoice. Although invoicing itself is a task for the finance department, it often involves an administrative task for the seller. The deal should be documented, handed over for delivery and sent to finance for invoicing.

While the time for this procedure can vary greatly depending on whether it is a standardized or complex product or service, in many cases it can be a tedious and time-consuming burden.

However, with AI, many of the repetitive and
time-consuming tasks normally required in order management and invoicing can be automated


This means that companies can complete  processes faster, more accurately, while freeing up time for salespeople to focus on more important things. According to McKinsey, this process can be automated by up to 50%. 24

Moreover, AI has become an indispensable companion for credit control. With AI-based tools like Experian’s CreditScore, a customer’s creditworthiness can be analyzed in real time, reducing the risk of businesses getting into situations of unpaid invoices or non-payment. AI systems are also able to identify anomalies and problems in an order or invoice and deal with them quickly.

Examples of AI-powered order management and invoicing include companies like Coupa, Tradeshift and Rossum. These companies
offer AI-based platforms to automate the flow of orders, check creditworthiness, optimize invoicing processes, and monitor payment status in real time.

For a salesperson, this means that they can use the systems to automatically generate an order based on the signed contract, create automatic invoices and keep track of every step of the delivery process and communicate with the customer about any delays or problems. The systems also allow you to monitor invoices and ensure that they are paid on time. The seller can receive reminders of overdue payments and take the necessary action.

Ultimately, the use of AI in order management and invoicing has changed the way businesses conduct their financial transactions. It has increased efficiency, reduced risks and allowed companies to focus on more strategic and value- creating activities.

Introduction
7.1 THE  IMPORTANCE OF
LOYAL CUSTOMERS


In a world where the battle
for customers is getting more intense every year, retaining existing customers is crucial. The research is also clear:
it costs significantly more to acquire  a new customer than to nurture and retain an existing one.



Moreover, it is well-known that satisfied customers are more likely to remain loyal and continue doing business with the company. Investing in nurturing, developing and retaining existing customers therefore has a tangible impact on the profitability and long-term success of businesses.

In this chapter, we explore the potential of AI to streamline and improve the way companies manage their customer relationships. This includes various aspects of customer care, from effectively onboarding new customers
to delivering effective support and customer service. We will also examine how AI can be used to increase cross-selling as well as up-selling. Furthermore, we will explore how AI can predict and counteract customer churn, which can ultimately lead to significant revenue increases. Finally, we will examine how AI can simplify
the conduct of customer satisfaction surveys and provide companies with insights that allow them to continuously improve their services and products.

This journey into AI-driven customer care explores opportunities, tools and strategies that can help your business achieve greater loyalty, growth and success by putting customers at the center.

7.2 AI-BASED ONBOARDING
OF NEW CUSTOMERS


Maintaining your position in the B2B market - or growing - requires an ongoing effort to acquire new customers. But the challenge is not only
to acquire new customers, but also to gain and maintain their loyalty.


The first step after winning
a new customer is therefore to ensure a good onboarding process that lays the foundation for success.



This includes welcoming and introducing the customer to products or services, providing them with all necessary information and ensuring a smooth transition from the customer showing interest to becoming an active and engaged
user. The process may vary depending on the industry, product or service, but some common objectives and activities include introduction, needs assessment, design of customized solutions, training, testing, quality assurance  and deployment.

Offering a structured onboarding process allows the customer to realize the value of the product or service more quickly. It gives  them a clear guidance to make the best use of the offers. A well-planned onboarding process also builds trust and strengthens  the relationship with the customer, which in turn can lead to a long-term cooperation with increased loyalty.

If we are looking  at AI tools that can support the onboarding process, Customer Data Integration (CDI) would be a good start. CDI is a process
and technology used to collect, organize and centralize customer information from various



Copyright © Mercuri International

data sources within an organization. The goal is to create a unified and comprehensive view of customer data that can benefit different business functions and departments. This includes information such as name, contact
details, purchase history, behavioral patterns and preferences. Getting a complete picture of the customer increases the possibility of accurate and consistent onboarding. A variety of solutions
are available for this purpose, such as Informatica
and Talend.

Another technique is IDP, Intelligent Document Processing, which involves AI interpreting and analyzing various documents such as contracts, support agreements and invoices and converting them into structured data, whether they are on paper or digital. Using IDP, and solutions like Google Cloud Document AI and Base64, delivery teams can quickly process various contracts and customer documents and provide customers with the services or products they need. This leads to
a smoother onboarding experience and more satisfied customers.

Besides the more administrative parts of the onboarding process, there are also solutions that try to automate things like technical implementation, configuration and training. By
setting timeframes and following the customer’s progress, various tasks can be automated
to avoid the risk of them being delayed or forgotten during manual handling. If a customer experiences initial problems, or is slow to get started, they can quickly be helped. You can also congratulate the customer when different steps are achieved to keep them motivated. Examples of solutions that aim to take such a holistic approach to customer onboarding are Churnzero and Totango.

Let’s look at an example. Imagine you are a seller of different software. You have just won a new customer - ABC Enterprises - which is
now being onboarded. The product should be implemented and employees of the customer should now start using your software. After
a careful handover to the delivery team, Churnzero now creates a timeline
with different milestones including different activities to be launched to ensure that the customer
is satisfied with the delivery. Immediately after registration, a welcome message is sent
to the relevant people in the customer’s organization
with information about the contact person and the account login.
When the customer

logs in, user accounts are automatically created and the software  is installed and configured.

Once the basic installation is complete, ChurnZero starts an introductory training series that sends weekly emails with guides and videos on how to use the software. Support and chatbots are available for any questions. ChurnZero monitors usage, tracks the customer’s overall progress and provides a ‘health rating’. If a customer falls behind  or gets stuck in the process, an automated follow-up is triggered, including a call from an account manager, customer success manager or product specialist. This way, problems can be quickly identified and the customer can
be helped to get back on track. The information can also be used to keep the customer motivated in the induction process, for example by congratulating them on various achievements.

The result is a smooth and customized onboarding process that helps ABC Enterprises quickly become successful users of the software.

7.3 AI-DRIVEN SUPPORT  AND
CUSTOMER SERVICE


Professional customer service is often central to the success of a business. Quality customer service not only solves customers’ problems but also tends to create greater loyalty to the company, which can lead to the next deal. Positive customer experiences often also lead to positive reviews
and recommendations, which can attract new customers. This type of organic marketing can be incredibly valuable and help drive new business. The customer service department can also collect
valuable feedback and insights about the company’s products and services, which can be used to make improvements. Thus, in many highly competitive markets, good customer service and companies
that care about their customers can be the deciding factor when customers choose a supplier.

In recent years, AI has become increasingly important in support and customer service cases. With AI, customers can be served faster and create a better customer experience. But despite its benefits, only 24% of companies are using AI in their customer contact centers.25 The main reason for this is that companies consider that their employees do not have the right skills. However, the low uptake of
AI in customer service will soon be a thing of the past. With its rapid development and many benefits, AI will soon be a natural component of every customer contact center.

Chatbots providing support and service to customers

One example of a solution that is becoming increasingly common to provide support and service to customers is chatbots. With these at their
disposal, businesses can automate and speed up the process of answering common customer questions, processing orders and troubleshooting basic problems. This also frees up time for human support and customer service staff (we’ll call them “agents” from now on) to focus on handling more complex cases. Using AI, chatbots can also learn, improving their ability to understand and solve customer problems over time.

25 https://www.salesforce.com/blog/contact-center-ai/?




Of course, a major advantage of chatbots is that
they are available 24/7, which means that customers can get immediate answers to their questions regardless of the time of day. In addition, chatbots can handle a large number of calls simultaneously, providing scalable solutions. A further feature is
that they can handle different languages, allowing for localization. Cultural adaptation can also be essential to meet different cultures’ etiquette, such
as signs of politeness - an avatar bowing to Japanese customers or avoiding direct eye contact with Chinese ones. This can lead to a more personalized and unique customer service experience, as customers receive assistance and recommendations tailored specifically to their needs and preferences.

Furthermore, AI can be used to generate summaries after a case has been closed. As this is a time- consuming process that often prevents agents from helping other customers, there are huge gains to
be made. AI can handle the most complex email and chat conversations and produce suggested summaries that agents only need to review and possibly adjust before filing them in the case logs.

There are many solutions for providing support and generating case summaries in customer support, such as LivePerson, Intercom, IBM Watson and Zendesk. Although they may seem to have some limitations, they are getting better and better. With so-called conversational AI, based on ChatGPT technology, we are getting closer and closer to the human ability to communicate.

Automatic generation of knowledge articles

According to a survey by Salesforce, 59% of customers prefer to use self-service tools to handle simple service issues. 26 Offering such tools requires an extensive knowledge base that customers can consult to find solutions to their problems.

Typically, agents are required to create knowledge articles after they have successfully resolved a case. This process is time-consuming as it requires manual drafting, review and publication of articles. This in turn limits the ability of agents to help customers
who need assistance.


Several tools, including Zendesk mentioned above, therefore also offer AI-based solutions to automatically generate knowledge articles after closed support cases. By leveraging information from case notes, message history, and data from other support tools, AI can suggest and create items. Then
it only remains for the agent to review the article to ensure its accuracy before it is put in the queue for approval. This automation removes the burden from agents to create items from scratch and frees up their time to help more customers.

AI to match customers with the right agents

Another exciting solution for improving customer support and creating a better customer experience is Afiniti. Afiniti is an advanced platform that uses AI to match callers with the right agent.

Let’s say customer “Anna” calls a contact center with a complex question about a product or service. In seconds, Afiniti analyzes Anna’s previous purchases, previous conversations with support, as well as the agents’ expertise and performance. After evaluating all this data, Afiniti automatically matches Anna with the agent who has the most appropriate skills to help her.

In this case, Anna is connected to ‘John’, an agent who has proven to be particularly successful with similar issues in the past. This increases the likelihood that Anna will get a quick and correct solution to her problem.




By optimizing the matching process, customer service can ensure that the most experienced agents handle the most demanding cases while less experienced agents can focus on simpler cases.

Analysis of telephone calls to support and customer services

AI can also analyze customer phone calls and provide real-time feedback to the support or customer service agent. An example of such a solution is Cogito, whose platform can be used in several ways. Firstly, it can interpret the customer’s emotional state by analyzing the customer’s
tone of voice and conversation patterns during the customer interaction. If Cogito detects that a customer sounds stressed or frustrated, it can give a warning to the agent and suggest a more
empathetic and compassionate tone to increase customer satisfaction.

Secondly, Cogito’s software can coach the agent by analyzing the conversation. At a detailed level, the agent can receive feedback on whether they talk too much or too fast, if they interrupt the customer or frequently use filler words such as “eeh” and “hmm”.

Another helpful support solution, as mentioned earlier in this report, is Chorus. This tool transcribes customer calls, i.e. converts speech into text.
There are several benefits to this procedure. The agent often needs to take notes while assisting customers during a phone call and transcription reduces the amount of notes that need to be taken. It also reduces the need to ask the customer to repeat order numbers and the like. The transcribed conversation can also be valuable for subsequent text analysis. What kind of problems do our customers have? Where are we lacking in products and services? What trends and patterns can we see over time? With solutions like these, it is possible
to get a better overall picture of the customer experience.



From a more comprehensive perspective, it also provides the opportunity to identify high performing agents and evaluate what distinguishes them
from others. With insights like these, managers are better equipped to coach their employees. Basing development efforts and behavioral changes on real data can eliminate much of the guesswork about which methods work. Managers therefore have an important role to play in providing analysis and

7.4 AI-DRIVEN CROSS AND
UP-SELLING


After the customer has used the product or service for some time, it is important to consider the possibility of upselling as a next step.


This can be done through cross-selling, offering complementary or related products or services to
suit the customer’s needs, or through up-selling, offering an upgraded or more advanced version of the product or service they already have.



In e-commerce, and in particular the B2C
sector, this is already common practice. Amazon suggests products “that you might also be interested in”. Similarly, Netflix recommends shows and movies that match your preferences. Both of these are examples of cross-selling. And it works. For example, Amazon’s cross-selling algorithm accounts for 25% of Amazon’s total
sales. It is also proven that product proposals that are tailored to the customer’s interests lead to higher customer satisfaction.

The good news is that, using the same AI algorithms, you can suggest suitable products and services to your B2B customers, which is

particularly appropriate the larger your product range.

AI can be used to analyze cross-selling and
up-selling opportunities on existing customers through predictive analytics. This means taking advantage of advanced algorithms to analyze data on customers’ purchase history, behaviors and preferences and then creating models to predict customers’ future purchases. In this way, AI can identify which products or services are most relevant to a specific customer and how to present these products or services effectively to increase the chances of cross or up-selling.

A practical example of this is how a large San Francisco bank used AI to increase cross and up- selling to its existing customers. The bank used
an AI-based analysis to identify which products and services were most relevant to their most profitable customers. By using algorithms that analyzed customer data, the bank was able to create a model that predicted which products or services a customer was likely to buy and why.

With this information, the bank could create more effective sales strategies and send more targeted marketing offers to specific customers. The bank could also use the model to identify its most valuable customers and work more actively to retain them by offering tailored offers and services. As a result, the bank was able to increase the conversion rate for existing customers by as much as 234%. A year later, this figure increased
to 386%, indicating that the bank managed to adapt and improve its AI model to achieve even better results. 27

If we look at concrete tools, there are solutions from IBM, Clari and Qymatix. All of these offer solutions that aim, among other things, to predict cross-selling and up-selling potential and make recommendations on which products or services to offer to different customers. The big difference between them is that IBM Watson for Sales is happy to adapt to complex sales processes, Clari focuses on understanding the sales process and
is more user-friendly, while Qymatix focuses solely on B2B sales and often integrates with CRM systems.

For those who run an e-commerce platform, there are also solutions. RichRelevance and Coveo both use predictive AI to analyze purchase history and behavior to automatically

make related product recommendations.
For example, if a customer shows interest in a particular product, RichRelevance may suggest complementary products or additional services. Similarly, if a customer searches for a particular product or service, Coveo suggests related products or upgrades, increasing the chances
of cross or up-selling. Coveo can also integrate with the email client and help sales teams identify cross-or up-selling opportunities by analyzing customer communications and suggesting relevant products or services.

7.5 AI TO COMBAT CUSTOMER
CHURN


Loss of customers (or ‘churn’) is when customers or users stop using the company’s services or products. This may be because they no longer need them, they go to a competitor, or they find a substitute. The concept of churn prevention
means taking various measures to retain existing customers and reduce the risk of them ending their business relationship. It is therefore about preventing customer defection or churn.

To retain customers, and reduce churn, businesses need to take proactive measures. This could include improving the product or
service, offering incentives or discounts to retain customers, providing better customer service or simply nurturing and caring for customers over time. Churn prevention is especially important for companies with recurring revenue, such as
subscription-based services, as dropouts directly affect the company’s revenue. By reducing dropouts, the company can maintain or increase its revenue and improve customer loyalty.


To measure customer loss, you can analyze what is known as the churn rate.
This is usually expressed as a percentage and represents the number of customers who have canceled their subscription or stopped using a service compared

to the total number of customers in a given period of time (e.g. a quarter or a year).



This figure of course varies greatly between industries, countries and products. For example, few customers change electricity suppliers, so the average loss of customers is a modest 11%. 28 This compares to industrial services and accounting services which have an average churn rate of 17% and 27% respectively. The highest churn rate is
for wholesale sales with an average churn rate of 56%, which can be explained by the highly competitive nature of the industry and the fact that many customers are more likely to switch suppliers.

Measuring the churn rate is crucial because it costs more to acquire new customers than to retain existing ones. Loyal customers  who buy for a long time also bring great economic benefits. According to a study by Bain & Company, a 5% increase  in customer loyalty can lead to a 25-
95% increase  in company profitability. Measuring the churn rate provides a better understanding
of how the customer acquisition and retention processes work, and can provide insights into how to extend the customer lifecycle. If the customer retention process is stable, it usually means
higher revenues and lower acquisition costs.

The reasons for dropping out can of course
vary. As well as competitors with better offers, it could be due to poor onboarding, dissatisfaction


28 https://oroinc.com/b2b-ecommerce/blog/b2b-customer-churn/




with customer service or the product or service not being exactly what you expected. But an estimated 15-30% of customers who leave a supplier do so for reasons within their control. 29

In this field, there are several competent AI tools for measuring churn rates and preventing customer loss. Examples of solutions from ChurnZero, Totango and Gainsight include measuring product usage and customer engagement. More specifically, they can calculate a ‘churn score’, so you can proactively address customer relationships that are heading in the wrong direction. The results can be presented for an individual organization as well as aggregated for all customers.

Just as you use AI in marketing automation to automatically generate information and offers for new customers, you can automatically generate emails, documentation, blog posts and the like
for existing customers to ensure they feel valued and seen. The solution can also identify patterns

that typically lead to customer churn, so that measures can be taken proactively. Opportunities for in-depth risk analysis exist, such as non- payment or late payment, high levels of customer support cases or reduced usage. Several of the solutions can automatically generate specific notifications where the risk of customer churn is highest.

A solution from Pega aims to predict future customer dropouts and customer needs based on various signals. They continuously analyze the customer’s actions and can recommend the next appropriate steps to take. Notably, the examples above are a selection of tools that can help
prevent churn in B2B companies. There are many others available, each with their own unique features and capabilities. It is important to choose a tool that is well adapted to the specific needs of your company and industry.

7.6 AI-DRIVEN CUSTOMER
SATISFACTION SURVEYS


Customer satisfaction and customer loyalty are two fundamental factors that play a crucial role in the success of businesses, especially in the B2B sector. Customer satisfaction is a feeling  of
satisfaction or disappointment that occurs when customers  interact with a company’s employees, products or services. According to a study by Bain
& Company, companies that consistently deliver high levels of customer satisfaction are 60% more profitable than their competitors.

Customer satisfaction is also directly linked to customer loyalty, meaning that satisfied customers are more likely to continue doing business with a company and recommend it to others. Consulting firm Accenture has found that
93% of B2B companies that focus on improving customer satisfaction also experience increased customer loyalty. Measuring and understanding these factors  is therefore crucial to ensure long- term growth and competitiveness.

Some common methods for measuring
customer satisfaction include surveys, interviews and customer support data. Surveys can be particularly valuable as they allow businesses to collect feedback directly from their customers. This can then be used to identify and improve gaps in products, services, processes or other interfaces between a company and its customers.

Another similar method that is becoming increasingly important in business-to-business is to analyze won and lost business, known as win- loss analysis. Research by Mercuri International shows that companies that consistently analyze wins and losses have on average 5-10 percentage points higher revenue growth than companies

that do not. The advantage of this type of analysis is that it focuses on analyzing both won and lost customers  and provides detailed insights into
how customers perceive things like brand, sales professionalism, offer, price and other added values such as service, technology and value for money. 30

Whatever the method or type of survey, artificial intelligence can offer significant benefits by improving and streamlining the process of measuring customer satisfaction and loyalty. With AI, companies can create more sophisticated surveys, analyze data faster, and gain real-time insights into customer satisfaction.

One tool that can help here is Qualtrics, an advanced survey and feedback platform that uses AI to give companies insights into customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and how customers perceive their products and brand. Using AI, the software analyzes open-ended survey responses, categorizing them and identifying key themes and patterns. It can also predict future customer behavior and trends based on collected data, helping companies make more data-driven decisions.

Another popular survey platform that offers AI-based features to improve survey design and analysis is SurveyMonkey. Their AI tool,
SurveyMonkey Genius, guides the user through
the entire process from developing questions to making recommendations on survey length, potential question types and possible answers to increase the response rate and quality of the data collected. It can also provide an estimate of how long it will take to complete the survey and how well it will perform compared to other surveys. When analyzing survey responses,
SurveyMonkey uses AI to quickly identify trends
and key insights to help users make better decisions.

AI can also be used to deepen the analysis of survey responses to better understand what drives customer loyalty, for example. An example of this is Chattermill. By integrating this AI-powered platform
with other tools,  it can collect and analyze customer feedback in order to discover what drives customer loyalty and retention.

Beyond surveys, AI can also be used to measure customer satisfaction  in real time by

collecting and analyzing data from a variety of sources, such as customer reviews, social media, emails, website visits, chats, and phone calls. This type of sentiment  analysis, which is based on trying to detect whether the tone is positive or negative, gives companies a more detailed and nuanced understanding of customer emotions, opinions and behaviors, allowing for faster and more accurate decision-making.

It is also possible to measure customer satisfaction more specifically, such as how well the company’s website is perceived. In fact, you don’t have to ask a single question, but through intelligent analysis of visitors’ sessions, you can study their behavior and identify bottlenecks and instances where expectations cannot be met. Fullstory and others offer solutions for this specific niche.

In conclusion, customer satisfaction and customer loyalty are of great importance for B2B companies, and measuring these factors
is crucial for long-term success. AI can improve and streamline this work by providing powerful tools to create and analyze surveys and measure customer satisfaction  in real time.

Chapter 8:

RISKS AND CHALLENGES OF AI



8.1 ETHICAL  AND  MORAL
ASPECTS OF AI


In this report, we have focused on describing
the opportunities and benefits of introducing AI into the sales process. But there are also several risks that need to be taken into account, not least when  it comes to the ethical and moral aspects of the technology.

One of the most fundamental ethical questions about AI in sales is how it is used to collect
and manage customer data. AI can process large amounts of data much faster and more efficiently than humans, but this also means there is a greater risk of misuse or unintended consequences. For starters, companies using AI for data collection must ensure that their practices are compliant with the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and that customer privacy is protected. This means that data should be collected in a transparent way, that customers should be able to give their consent and that the company is clear about how the information  will be used. In addition to the legal consequences
of misuse, it can also have major negative consequences in terms of loss of customer confidence.

An example of this is the so-called Cambridge
Analytica scandal. The scandal broke in March
2018 when  it was revealed that the British data analytics company had collected personal data from millions of Facebook users without their consent. The information was then used to
create psychographic profiles and target political advertising and messages to users based on their personality traits and political preferences. The scandal not only affected users’ privacy, but also the trust in Facebook and other companies that worked with Cambridge Analytica. This led to the bankruptcy of the company and a wide-ranging discussion on how to manage and protect personal  data in a digitalized world.

With artificial intelligence, it is now also possible to create realistic images and videos of people, known or unknown, saying or doing things they have never said or done. The risk of this type of
‘deep fake’ is that it can be misused  in marketing and sales by misleading and manipulating customers, creating a range of potential problems.


One of the most prominent risks of deep fake is the spread of false information and rumors. By creating fake videos or images of famous people promoting or denouncing products, services or brands, competing companies
can damage each other’s reputation and sales.
This can lead to crises of confidence and legal disputes, damaging the interests of both businesses and the public.



An example of deep fake is the case of a fake video of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, posted on Instagram in 2019. In the video, Zuckerberg claimed that he controlled the




data of billions of people and used it to increase his power and wealth. Although the video was quickly exposed as a deep fake, it showed how easy it is to create and spread misleading and harmful content using this technology.

With the development of language models such as ChatGPT, it is also important that the texts produced by AI, such as articles and blogs, are reviewed by humans. While a model like this
is capable of generating texts on a seemingly infinite number of topics, it cannot provide any guarantee that its output  is right, only that it sounds right. Its strength lies not in recalling facts, but in generating texts that sound human. In some cases, therefore, the text generated will
be perceived as correct, but in fact be inaccurate, as it may simply make up things that are outright wrong or contradictory. For this reason, AI-
based content always needs to be reviewed and validated in order not to spread misinformation.

A further aspect is copyright. Since no one really knows where AI models like ChatGPT get their data from, this is likely to become a bigger issue in the debate. Literally everything they create,
from music to videos to lyrics, is based on existing material belonging to someone else. From that perspective, it is not surprising that there are
now several intellectual property and copyright infringement lawsuits against generative AI companies, such as the New York Times blocking OpenAI’s web robot from training its AI models using their material. 31


Another ethical aspect of AI is potentially discriminatory algorithms. If AI systems
are trained on distorted or biased data, they can
reinforce and reproduce

existing prejudices and produce so-called “biases”.



One of many examples of this is the AI-based text-to-image creator Midjourney, launched in 2022. When asked to produce an image
based on the command “influential person”, it generated four images of older white men, and on the command “someone who is intelligent”,  it generated four images of older white men with glasses. 32

Another example is when Amazon developed an AI-powered recruitment tool to find the best candidates for jobs within the company. This tool was designed to analyze CVs and qualifications to quickly identify the most promising candidates. But it soon became clear that the tool reinforced established prejudices and discriminated
against female applicants. Since the AI system was trained on previous employment data from Amazon, where an overwhelming  majority of employees were men, the system developed a bias towards male candidates. This meant that women were less likely to be recommended as top candidates by the AI system, even if they had equivalent qualifications.

Amazon soon discovered the problem and suspended the use of the AI tool in 2018. This example underlines how AI, if not carefully monitored and adapted, can reinforce existing biases and lead to undesirable consequences for companies relying on AI for marketing or other purposes.

Furthermore, it is important to be open and transparent in how you use AI in your sales. As a customer, we want to know when and if AI is used and how it adds value. For example, if AI is used
to analyze the customer’s emotional state in a video meeting, companies should be open about this and ask the customer’s permission. The same

applies to images or videos used for advertising or marketing purposes. As it is almost  impossible for a human to distinguish between a real human face and a synthetic face produced by AI, this must be made clear. It is therefore important for those who choose to use AI-generated images or photos to make this clear so as not to mislead the recipient.

Similarly, if we choose to use an AI chatbot on the website, the recipient should be informed that this is the case. Instead of pretending to be a human, you should be clear in introducing the chatbot with a simple explanation, such as “Hi! I am [Bot name], an AI assistant here to help you with your questions.”

Companies can also publish their policies and guidelines on how to use AI on their website. This, together with regular reporting on their use of
AI, including progress, challenges and lessons learned, gives customers and stakeholders an understanding of how the technology is being used and what security measures are being taken

to protect their privacy.

It is also important to consider how AI systems can be used in a way that respects human values and follows societal norms. This means that companies should focus on using AI to improve the customer experience and create value for their customers, rather than simply maximizing profits and automating tasks at the expense of human labor.

By following these ethical and moral principles and being transparent about how AI is used in marketing, companies can build trust with their customers and ensure that AI technology is used responsibly and respectfully.

















It is also important to
  consider how AI systems can be used in a way that respects human values and follows societal norms.



8.2 IMPACT ON JOBS AND
EDUCATION


One of the biggest challenges and concerns about AI is the fear that it can make people redundant. A recent BBC article suggests that there are now growing concerns about how AI will affect not only our jobs but also society as a whole. 33




In 2022, even before the launch of ChatGPT, a global workforce survey by PriceWaterHouseCoopers showed that nearly a third of employees worldwide were concerned that their jobs would be replaced by technology within three years. This concern seems to spread quickly and creates a greater fear of the unknown.

To some extent, this concern is justified. According to a report by investment bank Goldman Sachs, AI has the potential to replace around 300 million full-time jobs. 34 Ultimately, if our jobs involve analyzing and interpreting information to make decisions, it is very likely that machines can now perform this at least as accurately and arguably much faster than we can. These developments indicate that many
jobs are at risk of disappearing, being replaced or changing in the coming years.


However, the truth is that while some AI systems are good at certain tasks, AI is generally not good enough to completely replace the

skills required to do most work.



Issues with self-driving vehicles have not been fully resolved yet. Despite billions of dollars of investment and many companies reaching the testing stage, we are not at the point where bus or taxi drivers are at risk of immediate
replacement. This is also true for professions that require a high degree of creativity, empathy and social interaction, such as health professionals, psychologists, hairdressers and salespeople in complex solution selling.

Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that some jobs are particularly vulnerable, as we can also learn from history. Many routine jobs in manufacturing have already been replaced by machines. Other examples include bank clerks, cashiers, telemarketers, warehouse workers, accountants and travel agents.  All of these have decreased as technology can perform the same tasks more cost-effectively and efficiently. But it is not only simple, repetitive, routine jobs that may disappear - knowledge work is also becoming increasingly vulnerable.

For example, engineers, brokers, economists,
real estate agents, educators,  lawyers and judges have long been exempt from automation, but their numbers may decrease over time. What happens when advanced AI software can find more legal cases in a day than a lawyer can in a lifetime? Or when a brain scanner can detect fraud and lies with almost 100% accuracy at the touch of a button? In the not too distant future,


33 BBC (2023-04-18), Many workers worry AI is coming for their jobs. Can we get past the fear and find a silver lining?
34 Forbes (2023-03-31), Goldman Sachs Predicts 300 Million Jobs Will Be Lost Or Degraded By Artificial Intelli- gence




we may have such lie detectors in practical use. How many prosecutors and defense lawyers will be made redundant?

However, it is important to emphasize that automation is not just about job loss. In many cases, this is a change where an existing professional role has lost its relevance and needs to be replaced by a new role or needs to be upgraded with new skills and competences. In its 2020 Future of Jobs Report, the World
Economic Forum estimated that up to 85 million jobs would be lost by 2025 due to automation and technological change. At the same time, the report predicted that 97 million new jobs would be created, implying a net job growth.

“40% of the total workforce, equivalent to about
1.4 billion workers, will need to be retrained in the next three years as a consequence of AI and automation.”

Many professionals will thus need to upgrade their skills and knowledge as a result of the rapid developments in AI. IBM agrees, claiming in a report that AI will not necessarily replace employees, but those who embrace the possibilities of AI will have an advantage over
those who do not. The report highlights that 40% of the total workforce, equivalent to around 1.4 billion workers,  will need to be retrained in the next three years as a consequence of AI and automation. 35 This trend is visible not only in the technology sector but also in areas such as retail, education and finance, where the need for AI skills is increasing.



A study by Mercuri International shows that this also applies to sales organizations. The Future State of Skills report, which interviewed over
1,000 commercial managers, found that 9 out of
10 managers experience a skills gap in their sales and marketing organization. 36

Not surprisingly, one of the main reasons for this was the rapid development of technology. The rapid influx of new technological applications in sales creates some recognition that something
is happening. Between 2017 and 2021 alone, the number of digital tools available for sales increased by 450%, from 200 to 1100. Today  it is almost impossible to calculate the number.

Keeping up with the rapid developments and staying up to date with new tools is therefore not an easy task. It is even more difficult to select from the offer, implement the necessary technology and at the same time retrain and/or recruit new employees with the right skills to benefit from
it. What is clear is that many roles will need to change their nature, with us learning to work with technology rather than being replaced by it. In other words, AI will not replace the salesperson, but an individual who can handle AI will.

For this reason, it is important not to ignore the emergence of AI and think that it will not affect your job, company or industry. Because it will, whether we like it or not. Some concern is therefore justified. But instead of panicking or worrying about potentially losing your job to a machine or AI, you should invest time in
embracing the technology, being curious, and trying to take advantage of the opportunities
it brings. Ultimately, it is those who see AI as an asset  rather than a threat  that will be sought after and valuable in the future labor market.

8.3 HOW TO GET STARTED
WITH AI?


For many, getting  started with AI can seem a long uphill battle, especially if there is no experience or expertise within the company. In addition,  it can be difficult to navigate the rapid developments and the huge variety of different AI-based tools
on the market.

There are of course many different ways to get started and implement AI because the needs and goals of different organizations can be so

different. For a company that seriously wants to take advantage of AI and, for example,  wants to review all processes in a company, it is important that the initiative comes from the management team or even the board of directors. Especially if
it involves changing the business model or if it is a question of how to increase shareholder value.


Take a look at Tesla.














What did Tesla do when they started selling cars?

Well, they made sure that, using sensors,  cameras and internet connectivity, they had access to all the driving data generated from their customers. This includes everything from car performance,
position, speed, environment, energy consumption and driver behavior. These sensors monitor acceleration, braking, changes in direction
and weather conditions, among other things.The cameras provide information on the trafc situation, signs, road markings and possible obstacles.

All this data has given Tesla an edge over many competitors, contributing to an improved customer experience but also providing ideas for new innovative solutions.



Copyright © Mercuri International                                                                                                                                                                         115




In this case, where Tesla has built its main product on AI, it is therefore a question of the company’s overall strategy and objectives. Thus, it must
be an issue that should be addressed in the management or boardroom.

Another reason why AI is in many cases an issue for the management team is the need to comply with applicable laws, regulations and ethical principles. If employees start using AI without any code of conduct, there can be serious consequences in terms of intentional or unintentional misuse of AI, such as discrimination or invasion of customers’
or employees’ privacy. It may also involve risk management, which is a key part of management’s responsibility. It involves identifying, assessing and managing risks associated with AI technologies, such as cybersecurity, technical failures, unintended consequences and possible financial losses due to incorrect AI decisions.

At the same time, the issue of liability must also be carefully examined. If something goes wrong, who is responsible? The department that requested the AI service, the programmer behind it or the senior manager? To avoid future conflicts and also to protect employees, it is important to develop a clear division of roles and responsibilities.


To successfully implement AI organization, also needs to
company invests su resources in AI
This means
AI initiatives and ensuring that the right skills are available within

the organization to run these projects successfully.



Whether or not AI is an issue for the management team also depends on its scope. Is it about
starting to use one or more AI tools available on the market, or is the idea that the company will develop its own AI solutions?

For a salesperson who wants to get up and running quickly and take advantage of the available solutions, and who has received approval from the company’s management, it is important to start by understanding the basics. You don’t need to be
an expert  in programming to benefit from AI tools, but it can be helpful to get a basic understanding of different terms and how AI works.

The second step is about learning critical skills, experimenting and testing. For example, this
report can serve as inspiration to identify a number of suitable tools to start experimenting with. Many of them are also free or offer the possibility to test the tool before deciding to order.

For an HR, sales, or marketing department that wants to take a broader view of the possibilities of AI, the process can be expanded. The process could look like this:


1          Identify needs

Start by identifying your organization’s needs and objectives. What marketing tasks and processes can AI facilitate or improve? This may involve automating certain tasks, analyzing customer data, optimizing advertising or improving the customer experience. Understanding what your organization wants to achieve makes it easier to choose the right tools.


2 	Explore which tools match the needs
AI technologies vary in complexity and functionality. Some tools are specialized to solve specific problems, while others are more general and can be adapted to
different needs. Make sure you understand how the different tools work and what opportunities they offer. It is important
to choose a tool that both fits your needs and has a technology that is scalable and adaptable to future challenges. The solutions should also be relatively easy to integrate
with existing IT systems and platforms.


3 	Compare prices and work with your budget
AI tools can vary widely in price, and it’s important to find a solution that fits your organization’s budget. Review both initial costs and any ongoing charges. Consider also that the investment in AI can bring a return in terms of efficiency gains and better decision-making.

4      Evaluate  ease of use

To get the most out of your AI tool, it is important that it is easy to use and that employees feel comfortable using  it. Feel free to test different tools and evaluate their user interface before making a decision.


5      Check support and training

A good AI tool comes with good support and training resources. Make sure you choose
a provider that offers support, updates and training to ensure your team can use the tool effectively and get the most out of the investment.


6      Choose a few tools to start with

Finally, it’s about choosing a few tools. According to a survey by Salesforce, sales teams use an average of ten different tools. Two out of three salespeople responded that they have too many sales tools in their toolbox. So start small and choose carefully.




For those who want to complement this with analysis based on their own internal data, or even develop their own AI-based solutions, the process can be broadened further. In simple terms, this process can be described in seven steps:


1          Define goals and strategy

Identify what problems or challenges you want AI to solve, and how AI technology can help achieve your company’s overall goals. Develop a clear strategy that describes
how the AI initiatives will be integrated
into the company’s existing processes and operations.


2       Map existing data

Examine what data is already available in the company and how it can be used to train AI models. This can be campaign data, financial data, customer data or data from different customer activities, but also external data that can be purchased, for example from social media or different databases.

3 	Prepare the data and select the model
Preparing data is about ensuring that the data is of high quality and is “washed” from duplicates and misleading data. The data should then be appropriately structured to be used for analysis in the relevant model.
It can take advantage of existing solutions or develop a completely new one.


4       Train the model

Train the AI model using the prepared data, which can take anything from a few seconds to several weeks depending on the complexity.

5      Evaluate the model

Evaluate the model to see if it meets the requirements and provides high performance. Testing several different models is a common practice-the process is iterative.


6      Implement the system

Once the training is completed, the developed AI solutions are incorporated into the company’s existing systems and processes. This may involve adapting workflows, developing new user interfaces,
and ensuring that AI solutions work smoothly with existing technologies and solutions.


7	Monitor and optimize the system
After implementation, the system needs to be monitored to ensure that the AI solutions continue to be effective and relevant.
If necessary, the model can be adjusted and updated.





























In summary, getting  started with AI can be
perceived as difficult. But there are ways to facilitate the process. For the employee who wants to get started quickly, it’s all about experimentation and testing, while for a company that wants to make AI a business strategy, it’s about carefully setting goals, strategies and planning to implement AI as effectively as possible in the company.









































Chapter 9:

KEY CONCEPTS AND TERMS IN AI




In Artificial Intelligence, there are many concepts and terms that can be difficult to understand but also relevant to know. Here we list some of the most common terms and concepts in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).


1	AI: Artificial intelligence - the technology that allows computers to perform
tasks that traditionally require human intelligence. AI technology is used in today’s society in many ways, such as voice recognition, image recognition, self- driving cars, chatbots and much more.


2 	Machine Learning: A technology that allows computers to learn and improve performance on a task by analyzing data. One example of the use of machine learning is Netflix, which uses an algorithm to recommend movies and TV shows based on the user’s previous viewing history.


3 	Deep Learning: A subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to train computers to perform complex tasks such as voice recognition and image recognition. One example is self-driving cars that use deep learning technology to identify obstacles and traffic signs on the road.


4 	Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing subset of AI that involves using advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to create images, video, music, speech, text, software code and product design. In recent years,
the development of generative AI has advanced significantly, and it is now used in different industries for different purposes.

5 	Neural Networks: A structure that simulates the function of the brain and consists of several layers of nodes that process information. Neural networks are used in medical diagnostics to identify tumors in X-ray and MRI images.


6 	NLP: Natural Language Processing - a branch of AI that focuses on getting computers to understand and process human language. NLP is used by virtual assistants such as ChatGPT, Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri to understand and respond to questions asked in natural language.


7	Computer Vision: A branch of AI that focuses on making computers capable of “seeing” and analyzing images and
video. An example of the use of computer vision is in surveillance systems that can detect and identify criminals or suspicious behavior. Using high-resolution cameras and advanced image recognition, the system can identify behaviors such as robbery, vandalism or illegal parking and alert the police or security personnel.


8 	Robotics: The use of robots to automate processes and perform tasks. For example, robotics is used in industrial automation
to automate production processes and to help people with disabilities perform daily tasks.


9 	Chatbot: A program that uses natural language to interact with people and answer questions. Chatbots are used by many companies to provide customers with quick answers to questions about products and services.




10	Data mining: A process that uses technology to find patterns and information in large amounts of data. Data mining technology is used in e-commerce to analyze customer behavior and make product recommendations.


11	Algorithm: A sequence of instructions that a computer can use to perform a specific task or solve a problem. An AI algorithm
is usually designed to learn from data, for example to identify patterns in large data sets or make decisions based on a number of factors. Algorithms in AI can be based on a variety of techniques, including machine learning, deep learning and regression analysis.


12	Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): A hypothetical form of artificial intelligence that would be capable of solving problems and performing tasks that a human intelligence can. AGI would have the
ability to learn and understand a variety of tasks and situations, adapt to new situations, reason and solve problems, communicate naturally, and take initiative and make decisions independently. AGI
is considered one of the most ambitious and challenging goals in AI research, and researchers have yet to develop a fully functional AGI.


13	Singularity: Usually described as a hypothetical point where technology becomes so advanced and self-
improving that it exceeds human ability to understand, control or predict its effects.

These are just a few examples of common concepts in AI. There are, of course, many more terms and concepts in this field that may be relevant
depending on what you are interested in.

10.1 INTRODUCTION


As you have probably noticed by now, there is an almost unlimited range of different AI-based solutions and tools that can be used to streamline different parts of the sales process. Of course, trying to get to grips with all these tools can be overwhelming. Our advice is therefore to start
by identifying what problems or challenges you want AI to solve for you and how these solutions can contribute to your company’s overall goals and strategies. You can then consider appropriate AI-based tools.

The tools presented in this report are examples that will hopefully serve as inspiration and guidance. However, it is up to you to decide what is suitable for your business.

We want to highlight again how fast developments in AI are happening right now. This means that many of the tools we provide examples of may have changed, disappeared or integrated with other tools since the publication of this report. Moreover, many tools have a
much broader functionality than that which
we describe.  But for simplicity, we have tried to categorize them according to some main areas of application.
