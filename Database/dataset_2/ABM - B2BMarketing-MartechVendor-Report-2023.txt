Introduction 
About the Martech Vendor  Spotlight Report series 
It’s hard to imagine the world of B2B marketing without martech. It has    
been one of the primary drivers of transformation in the profession for  
almost two decades, and continues to accelerate in terms of scope and  
consequently potential. But the explosion in the number of vendors  
leads to a bewildering array of products and solutions for even the  
most technologically proficient marketers – it’s already a complex  
environment, and it’s progressively becoming harder and harder to  
assess what’s available and (more important still) what’s most relevant for  
specific needs and use cases. That’s precisely the problem that we’ve  
tried to address in launching this series. 
Joel Harrison  Editor-in-chief at B2B Marketing 
Each report will zero in a particular technology category or use case  area and assess the vendors within it based on a selection of carefully  chosen set of criteria. Why are we examining the vendors rather than  
technologies themselves, you might reasonably ask? Surely it’s the  product that you’re actually buying, and should therefore need to know  about? Well, it’s been long understood by technology analysts such as  Peter O’Neill, the author of this report, that it’s the vision of the vendor  itself, plus its ethos and ways of working that are most critical to success  in the implementation of martech on a strategic basis. 
No matter how seductive or exciting the functionality, marketers are  not just buying kit – they are buying into a long term partnership, which  requires two way alignment and commitment. The insights in this report  will give potential buyers an unrivalled view of the solutions in this  key category, and as such will be an invaluable resource in a potential  purchase process. I hope it helps you make a better, more informed  decision about tech for your future ABM needs and enables you to  manage your ongoing marketing transformation.

ABM market background and context 
ABM has been a long-established marketing/sales methodology at business services companies,  where success depends so much on personal empathy and the relationship. The trend towards digital  marketing, tooled by technology advances in website and general data analytics, now encourages  almost all B2B businesses to adopt an ABM strategy based on the collection of behavioral and profile  data about individual buying decision makers.  
The shift to more digital marketing channels has been accompanied by the adoption of more customer centric or even personalized content marketing; and a definite shift to more marketing programs based  upon the needs of accounts as opposed to individual contacts. In parallel, because of the spread of  ecommerce preferences into B2B buying, there has also been a tectonic shift of the selling motion itself  in many B2B businesses, away from the sales organization to digital programs. 
  
Page 3 Martech Vendor Spotlight Report: Account-Based Marketing
During the COVID-19 disruption, those companies who did not have an established account-based  marketing (ABM) strategy found that they were not quick enough to pick up changes in the behavior and  preferences of their target customers. So, there is a clear reaction across many B2B sectors to planning  new investments in ABM technologies such as predictive analytics, advertizing retargeting and account-profiling. 
The most-early adopters of ABM, and therefore the most experienced practitioners, are to be found in  the services and software industries. But now these technologies can also be found in the B2B financial  services and healthcare companies and increasingly, across the manufacturing sectors.
ABM data programs can then be used to support one  
or more of the following business processes: 
• Post localized contextual content marketing programs to profiled visitors. 
• Send personalized/specific digital marketing content to individual prospects. 
• Capture prospects who may have left the website unsatisfied by re-targeting.  
• Gather and calculate “propensity to buy” data (per company or prospect) 
and provide this data to sellers.  
• Collate individual digital behavior into an aggregation across a buying team to provide more guidance to marketing and sales. 
ABM is first and foremost a strategy. It first needs to be agreed as such across the company with the  necessary organization and processes set up. And it is then implemented across all aspects of marketing  and sales, including digital marketing where the technology described in this report can be applied.  
Adoption of ABM is an important signal of marketing and sales alignment. Sales works on accounts - lead  generation at a contact level is a neophyte marketing output and considered essentially useless by sales. 
The Martech Vendor Spotlight for Account-Based Marketing (ABM) is a broad mix of vendors with a wide  variety of claims: data collection and analytics, targeted advertizing, marketing campaign orchestration,  enabling intelligent engagement, and even sales enablement. ABM is a purely B2B imperative – many  people would even say B2B marketing is ABM. But others would promote account-based marketing and  selling.

Assessment criteria 
In addition to providing useful information about the vendors in this landscape, this report will also  include an analysis and assessment of each vendor based upon four important criteria. These criteria  are critically important to potential buyer teams when evaluating and shortlisting vendors. The stress  being on CUSTOMER SUCCESS more than individual product features. These are the criteria: 
› Market Momentum Here, we have assessed how well a vendor helps prospective buyers to  understand the solution offering and how it fits into their environment. Vendors scoring highly  in this category will have an extensive team, or a network of business partners, of knowledgeable  pre-sales consultants or advisors.  
› Customer Focus Almost all software solutions are now delivered as a service and the most  successful SaaS vendors are those who help their clients on an ongoing basis, not just in response  to support calls. They invest heavily in customer success resources, including dedicated staffing and management attention, as well as information and training around the solution.  
› Price vs Value As with any business investment, marketing executives need to be assured that the  investments they make in technology are providing an appropriate payback. At the minimum,  vendors can help their clients calculate the return-on-investment after a period. More mature SaaS vendors are now providing value management consulting and processes for a more  continuous evaluation. 
› Implementation Success The true test of a business partnership is the commitment from a vendor to supporting the integration of their system with whatever the client has in place already. This attention to integration detail results not only in a smoother overall system, with no media breaks, but also ideal user adoption and application longevity.  
Our scoring is based upon general desk research, background interviews with B2B marketers and a website review by an experienced industry analyst. We have also interviewed the vendors in this  report and their replies and data provided will inform the scores we allocate in the vendor profile. We score each criterion as Strong, Good, Medium, or Low.

1. Vendor:    
PROFILE:
Founded in 2008 and based in Portland, OR, USA, Act-On has more than 4,000 customers globally. It continues  to be a favored vendor to replace failed first-generation lead management projects. It helps clients mature from  email marketing, through multichannel campaigning, to ultimately become “Adaptive Marketing Pros” with  complete processes incorporating sales and marketing. 
Act-On focuses its messaging on the insurance and financial services, business services, manufacturing, and  high-tech sectors. For those target markets, the vendor deploys sales playbooks and industry-specific agencies.  It also has dedicated content marketing and events for each industry. 
› Market Momentum 
Act-On sells directly from its offices in the US and UK, plus indirectly through nearly 100  partners, including 20 in EMEA. As well as a direct sales programs, Act-On leverages  
the partner ecosystems of leading players of adjacent markets like Microsoft, NetSuite,  Zendesk Sell, and SugarCRM. It also has some lucrative white-label distribution  agreements in specific industries. 
› Customer Focus 
The vendor enjoys a high 95% customer retention rate with a customer success team that  is just as large as their sales team. The company has over 170 employees and has been in  business for over 12 years now. It is probably the only vendor left focused solely on marketing  automation platforms and most of its customers use it for their ABM programs.  
› Price vs Value 
Act-On is unique as a SaaS vendor due to its active contacts pricing model. Active contacts  are the number of contacts a client engages within a given month and not the size of their  contact database which is the case with other solutions. Typically, the number of active  contacts is 40-50% of the total database each month, so the fact that Act-On fees are based  on the volume of active contacts fits makes the Price vs Value ratio more reasonable. 
› Implementation Success 
Act-On has a strong team of knowledgeable pre-sales consultants plus several  implementation partners. The vendor maintains a customer community where customers  can share ideas with each other while the website also includes extensive other educational  and community resources.

Interview with Jeff Day, SVP of Marketing Act-On, conducted by  Peter O’Neill, lead analyst at B2B Marketing and Propolis.
PON: Jeff, please describe your vision of B2B marketing today and how it will develop in the future. 
JD: Well, marketers have been buying technology for many years now and there has been a phase of  consolidation to suite of applications offered by the big five martech vendors who have been on acquisition  sprees. Now, customers are complaining about too much complexity and a shortage of skills to run the stuff,  leading to a limit on how much teams can get done. I believe that will drive a swing of the pendulum back to  best of breed solutions. We see AI becoming an integral part of all future marketing automation solutions. We  call it AI-driven everything because we are embedding AI technology directly into all our products – we do  not offer a separate AI module like others do. I think that AI functions like chatbots will become ubiquitous, a  critically important channel of communication for the future.  
Overall, I believe we will see the volume of outreach (email, social, calls) from B2B brands decrease-- because, let’s face it, we all get way too much today--but through AI the outreach will be higher quality, more  personalized, targeted, and timely. 
PON: That would imply that ABM will change in the future as well. Is that true? 
JD: We have been helping our marketing automation clients do account-based analysis, monitoring and  tracking for years now. Most of them also want us to pass sales intelligence from those systems directly into  the CRM or sales enablement system. So, clearly, ABM is more than just marketing. I am anticipating a merge  of ABM and marketing automation capabilities, and probably platforms, where the combined data, intent  signals, AI, and sales engagement processes will provide a more holistic view of engaged customers and  unified outreach across channels. 
PON: What are the most important ABM use cases that you see among your client base? 
JD: I would point to these four. Although they may just sound like B2B marketing basics, our ABM programs  in the Act-On platform have improved each of the processes. One is the classic of attracting net new  accounts, we help in targeting and interest generation. Then there is nurturing a pipeline of prospects.  An important marketing use case for our clients is empowering sales to leverage the knowledge we have  collected about target accounts and buying behavior. Lastly, the process of engagement with clients:  onboarding, collaboration, loyalty programs. 
PON: If Act-On is popular for one thing, it is their attention to customer success. How do you achieve that? 
JD: You are right. It has always been a strategic focus for our company. Our customer success teams are  well staffed with various skills to help clients leverage our software in the best possible manner. We have a  stream of customer success playbooks covering many different customer journeys and these maintained and  updated constantly to ensure that every client can learn from all other clients. The other programs like our  community and educational content support these activities.

2. Vendor:  
PROFILE: 
Established in 2000 as a full-service marketing agency serving the tech industry from 30 offices around the  world, Expandi is now well underway to becoming one of the most capable ABM data and software providers  for all B2B sectors. Expandi Group mainly operates in the market with the following brands: Expandi Match,  Expandi Agency, Cyance, AccountInsight and Session Media. In summer 2023, Expandi added the Jabmo  brand to its portfolio, having acquired the software assets from that company, which had gone into liquidation. 
Originally founded in 2014 in Paris, France, Jabmo is an account-based analytics, account-based advertizing,  social advertizing and email marketing platform. The core enabling technology is the Account Data Platform  (ADP) which maps both 1st and 3rd party data sources to accounts/sub-accounts/organizations/contacts. The  new Expandi Jabmo ABM platform, available since December 1st, now allows companies to engage audiences  via the following channels: display advertizing and retargeting, social advertizing, content syndication, web  personalization, email all in one place. 
› Market Momentum 
Expandi is probably now the largest B2B Demand Generation Agency in EMEA focused  
on the IT Sector with over 300 experienced marketeers. It delivers local and global  marketing programs, engaging over 500K prospects each year, through its own consulting  organization plus an extensive network of business and agency partners. 
› Customer Focus 
Unlike most B2B marketing agencies, Expandi handles every aspect of a multi-channel  campaign in-house, helping clients to define and implement their B2B marketing strategies  - ranging from strategic advice, target definition, content design and creation and campaign  delivery. It has invested highly in customer success resources with dedicated staffing and  executive management attention. 
› Price vs Value 
The Expandi value proposition is ‘Platforms built for Europe by Europeans.’ Its solutions are based on European needs (i.e. multi-language capabilities / semantic reading) and  constraints (i.e. GDPR). The vendor helps its clients to measure the return-on-investment for its projects on a routine basis.  
› Implementation Success 
One of their clients has written this: “The REACT model made sense for us from the beginning. If we could activate our 38 key accounts and create leads for the salespeople to follow up, we  had achieved our goal. Account based marketing will certainly be part of our strategy.“

Interview with Raffaele Apostoliti, CEO Expandi Group, conducted by Peter O’Neill, lead analyst at B2B Marketing and Propolis.
PON: Well, Raffaele, I suppose the purchase of the Jabmo software product now rounds out and completes  your ABM offering to your clients. 
RA: Perhaps so, our goal is to be one of the top ABM data and software providers in the market. We started  our transformation in 2021, acquiring AccountInsight, which had been awarded Best Emerging Technology  by your colleagues at B2B Marketing. They did programmatic advertizing and owned the largest database of  IP addresses in Europe. In 2022, we added Cyance, the leaders in Europe for Intent data. We acquired the  Jabmo assets this year after it had gone into liquidation as a company. I know that you’ve been writing about  them for quite a while, but your colleagues at Gartner, in December 2022, also had them in the Gartner  Magic Quadrant for ABM. We also have Expandi Match, our own B2B database developed since 2015 in house, the largest today in Europe covering 10 employees+.  
I am not sure if it is the end of our journey. There are some interesting functions and vendors out there that we  might want to take advantage of and expand even further. 
PON: The Jabmo customer base was mostly manufacturing and life sciences, which is complementary to  your broad client base in tech.  
RA: True. The Jabmo customers had their contracts cancelled of course when the company stopped  operating. We are now working on recruiting as many as possible as new Expandi clients. Also, there is great  potential in leveraging Jabmo for our existing clients.  
PON: How do you see B2B marketing as a discipline in 2023 and into the future? 
RA: Well, B2B marketing is now well and truly digital. The three most important skills and capabilities now  needed for B2B marketing success are 1) comprehensive data and data analytics; 2) a great application of  technology in-house; and 3) digital marketing that which is granular, persona-based and includes hyper targeting. This is not only a challenge for B2B marketers but also their agencies -- half of our clients are  actually B2B agencies who need assistance and back up for their B2B services.  
We ourselves only do ABM related services. We have service practices in digital analytics, digital advertizing,  marketing services such as search, and ABM consulting.  
PON: What makes you different, perhaps even unique, as an ABM provider? 
RA: We are European and we know European markets best of all. The European business world is so  different than the North American. Languages, currencies, regulations around compliance and GPDR, even  general customer and buyer behavior. That is all so challenging for an American vendor.

3. Vendor:  
PROFILE: 
TechTarget was founded in 1999, spun out of United Communications Group (UCG) with the founding “big  idea” that IT professionals are highly specialized and need high-quality, in-depth, fiercely independent content  to help in critical purchase decisions. Over time, it realized it surfaces real buyers’ journeys and began to offer a  lead generation service. Then, it built a rich account and prospect-level purchase-intent insight and data-driven  solution. The vendor has nearly 1,000 employees across North America, EMEA, LATAM and APAC.  
TechTarget’s core ABM product, Priority Engine™, has real tech-purchasing intent data from over 30 million  technology buyers who have opted-in to the database: data used by over 3,000 companies in the financial  service, healthcare and tech sectors. In late 2020, it acquired BrightTALK, a webinar and virtual events provider  and in 2021, it acquired Enterprise Strategy Group, a research and consulting group creating strategic  marketing/sales content for tech companies, and Xtelligent Healthcare Media, a healthcare media/marketing  services company. TechTarget is now a true end-to-end ABM provider with global scale: GTM strategy, content (short-form, long-form, digital, custom)/message development, targeting/demand identification, fit/selection, account and prospect level intent, engagement, multi-channel execution, services/support and reporting/measurement. 
› Market Momentum 
TechTarget has, historically, strong relationships with both medium-sized and enterprise tech  vendors, as well as marketing agencies that serve that sector. Its comprehensive suite of data 
driven offerings to help clients successfully plan, execute, manage and measure all aspects of  ABM has enabled it to grow into the healthcare and business services sectors as well.  
› Customer Focus 
The vendor’s dedicated customer success organization is almost as large as their sales and  business development department and is responsible for onboarding, are very focused  on renewals, and are also concerned with maximizing the lifetime value of its customers.  TechTarget won a CODiE Award for Customer Success Team of the Year in 2022 and it collects  customer satisfaction data periodically.  
› Price vs Value 
TechTarget proprietary intent data delivers insights at both account level and contact level to  provide full visibility into total buying teams at target accounts. That, plus the managed ABM  services provided by the vendor, helps customers to achieve breakthrough outcomes. The  vendor routinely assists clients to monitor their project ROI. It also offers several case studies  researched by external companies on its website. 
› Implementation Success 
The TechTarget customer success management team works on onboarding, training,  managing ROI, while the products/product ops manages in-tool user support, including  integration of their system with whatever the client has in place already.

Interview with John Steinert, CMO TechTarget, conducted by  Peter O’Neill, lead analyst at B2B Marketing and Propolis.
PON: Hi there John, please could you describe your vision of B2B marketing and how your organization  helps clients to excel? 
JS: I believe that to be optimally effective in this digital world, B2B marketing needs to be a continuous  activity to the same targets. The challenge there is that that can feel expensive when compared to the  alternatives. So, with our clients, we look for ways to create a continuous capability or presence within the  marketplace. Intertwined with this, of course, is the concept of optimized effectiveness. In most existing  martech stacks, this is very hard to do because tools and measures are so hard to reconcile. We help by  looking at it from a “jobs to be done” approach, both from what the marketer needs to get done (and the  best tools for that) and what the buyers need to get done and what’s most useful and necessary to them. We  help clients to find a synergy of the marketers’ KPIs and the buyers’ KPIs. 
At TechTarget, as a business model, we’re hugely invested in providing original editorial and analyst content  to the buyers. Our goal is to create spaces that aid decision making. And this is largely what clients come to  us for and what we work with them to emulate. 
PON: So how do you see the future of ABM in that concept? 
JS: Firstly, we think that it is more about ABM plus ABS (account-based selling). If we are to extend that  thinking out a step further, it has both pre- and post-sales implications, it has GTM implications, and that this  thinking include product/feature and solution thinking. ABM is really a misnomer; it was great for building  up interest in developing such a strategy but now we are seeing more a programmatic intertwining of CX  concepts and a greater digital transformation across buying and selling.  
PON: What are the most important ABM use cases that you support with your solutions? 
JS: I’ll give you two simple examples. For marketing, it is about “relevant availability and jobs to be done  relevance” – placement and context. For sales side, it is about helpfulness – strong relevance in time and  content against individual and buying group needs. 
PON: So how do you scope and plan your resources to help clients achieve that relevance and be successful  at ABM? 
JS: We see customer success is our core business and so we provide managed services across the board to  help our customers across the entire GTM spectrum.  
First is our continued commitment to first party editorial content and audience building and member ‘jobs to  be done” on which our business model is built. Second is prospect-level intent data and our Priority Engine  platform, as well as by extension some of our advanced intent-derived leads products. Third is our approach  to webinars, etc., which again is audience-needs focused … our BrightTALK.com is very different from a  simple webinar platform idea for that very reason. And lastly, our Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) research  and analyst division, which is unlike, say Gartner or Forester, which tend to be focused more broadly on  the vendor landscape as a whole. The bulk of ESG’s efforts focus specifically on working strategically with  individual clients to help them reach their GTM market objectives.

4. Vendor:  
PROFILE: 
Trust Radius is first and foremost a customer review site about software technology solutions and its goal is to be  the most trusted buyer decisioning platform in the software industry. The vendor now markets the intent signals  it collects from the review-site user base as an account-based marketing intent solution, focused very much on  producing high-quality late-stage buyer intent.  
With TrustRadius’ second-party, downstream intent data, clients can gain access to accounts that are actively  researching their own and their competitors’ products. 
› Market Momentum 
The vendor has around 200 customers in the technology sector and has grown by some 40% over the past years. TrustRadius sees that the current economy has made tech buyers  
more risk averse and is perpetuating their need for self-serve. They want more insider  product information upfront supported by clear ROI and customer proof. The vendors who  align their GTM strategies to buyer expectations will grow and set the foundation for success. 
› Customer Focus 
TrustRadius knows the industry and the customers they are serving extremely well. Their  customer success organization is actually larger than the sales team and it deploys over 20 different playbooks to ensure its clients are able to optimize their use of TrustRadius. 
› Price vs Value 
The vendor reports an average ROI across their customer base of over 500% with a payback  period of 90 days. It has value management experts within the sales team and there are several  customer testimonials attesting to ROI including statements like: “we salvaged three renewals  by contacting customers who were ready to churn and helping them resolve their issues”; “we found three new enterprise opportunities in three weeks with intent data” and “two alerts  in Gainsight from intent data resulted in a net retention of 122%”.  
› Implementation Success 
TrustRadius has a strong team of knowledgeable pre-sales consultants plus several  implementation partners. The intent signals found by TrustRadius can be easily integrated into CRM, ABM, and paid media channels, helping clients to find in-market buyers, close more deals, decrease churn, and raise revenue per customer. The vendor maintains a customer community where customers can share ideas with each other while the website also includes extensive other educational and community resources.

Interview with Allyson Havener, Senior VP of Marketing and Community,  conducted by Peter O’Neill, lead analyst at B2B Marketing and Propolis.
PON: Describe your vision of B2B marketing and how you help your clients to excel 
AH: We see four major elements of modern B2B marketing that we address directly. One is building trust  and credibility. Trust is a fundamental element in B2B transactions. TrustRadius, as a decisioning platform,  enables businesses to build credibility by providing a space for users to share their experiences with various  products and services. Reviews positive, neutral, or negative contribute to building trust among potential  buyers. The second is considering peer recommendations or the customer voice -- B2B buyers often seek  recommendations from peers and industry experts. This peer-to-peer validation can significantly influence  purchase decisions and enhance the reputation of the products or services being reviewed. Satisfied  customers can share their positive experiences, creating a pool of advocates who can amplify the brand’s  message and contribute to word-of-mouth marketing. TrustRadius customers can scale these efforts and use  customer voice capture in reviews across their marketing and sales channels.  
Thirdly, TrustRadius can serve as a valuable resource for businesses looking to make informed decisions.  Clients can compare different solutions, read about real-world use cases, and understand the strengths and  weaknesses of various products. This information helps businesses make decisions aligned with their specific  needs and goals. Lastly, we provide buyer intelligence. Knowing when buyers are in-market whether they are  researching your product or your competitors’ is crucial for B2B go-to-market. Being able to focus bottom funnel marketing campaigns and sales efforts towards buyers ready to make a purchase creates efficiencies in  pipeline generation and deal cycles. TrustRadius provides this type of intelligence to their customers so they  can find and engage in-market buyers and ultimately grow market share. 
PON: What is your understanding of the future of account-based marketing? 
AH: For ABM to be successful in the future, marketing needs to continue to align with sales and target  accounts, messaging, and timing of campaigns. Campaigns will need to be integrated, multichannel, and  AI will be crucial to personalize outreach at scale to break into these target accounts. But brands need to not  forget the top of the funnel activities to continually nurture accounts especially when they are not in-market.  These “passive” buyers will eventually realize they have a problem and then start researching solutions. You  must make sure your brand is trusted and top of mind. 
PON: How do you scope and plan your resources to ensure customer success? 
AH: Our CSM team is extremely consultative. In addition to our countless materials for customers to self learn with, our CSMs help clients optimize their campaigns with the buyer intelligence from our site, as  well as customer voice and proof points from the review. Our tools also help marketing and sales teams  align on which accounts to prioritize because they are in-market actively researching. Having the data and  customer generated content like reviews/quotes from the reviews is extremely powerful to attract their  target audience.

Interview with Michael McGoldrick, Vice-President Corporate Marketing,  conducted by Peter O’Neill, lead analyst at B2B Marketing and Propolis.
PON: Hello Michael, please begin by describing MRP’s vision of the B2B marketing discipline. What  challenges do you see your clients facing? 
NM: Over the past two decades most organizations have amassed a myriad of marketing technologies and  intent solutions that rarely work together well or provide a single view of their market, and now closely resemble  a martech black hole that nobody in their organization can manage. One of the main reasons for this is that  when marketers adopt the “best-of-breed” approach to construct their tech stack, they often find themselves  compelled to divert their focus from marketing to product management. We help our clients cut down on  complex tech stacks to build sustainable, high-impact demand generation programs. Our solution suite is  powered by account intelligence that aggregates downstream sources of intent and translates them into real  actionable recommendations – helping out clients to generate demand that aligns to their strategic priorities. 
PON: I distinctly remember our conversation when I was a Forrester Research Director back in 2015,  discussing the blog I had written about the cacophony of ABM vendors. Even then, we found common ground  regarding our definitions of ABM. How do you see ABM developing over the next years? 
NM: I remember it too. You strongly advocated that marketers did not need to purchase software for ABM,  just improve their strategy. ABM as a category needs a “rebrand” of sorts; Over the past 15 years or more,  we’ve allowed ABM and intent data vendors to be the ones who shaped and defined the category (We  accept some of this responsibility!). Their definition was largely centered around showcasing the capabilities  of their technologies. The sequence was not initiated by defining ABM as a strategic concept first and then  developing the technology to support it; instead, the technology outpaced the concept. Because ABM isn’t  a technology, it also shouldn’t be a category line item in a budget. Spend on ABM should spread across  supporting techs, with companies only spending money on technologies they need for a competitive  advantage. And while you still need technology to run ABM, every company’s GTM strategy is unique to  them and the technologies may vary, you can still do ABM without the bells and whistles of many of today’s  platforms. Fueled by account intelligence, MRP has the ability to deliver personalized and contextually relevant  messaging to our clients’ target accounts, across digital and non-digital channels, powering their ability to  accelerate bottom of funnel engagement while building top of funnel strategy – without the requirement of a  platform subscription. 
PON: Impressive. What are the most typical ABM use cases where MRP has been most successful? 
NM: We see these four scenarios the most in our client engagements: first and foremost, many of our clients  rely on us for net new acquisition. We provide the account intelligence that isolates brand opportunities while  delivering highly targeted buying center engagements, like content syndication, direct mail, advertising, and  outbound calling. Another scenario is the challenge of account renewal and account retention in recurring  revenue businesses. MRP can help clients to trigger engagements designed to help in contract renewals  (and then deliver campaigns and nurturing activities to ensure that renewal signature). Lastly, we address the  important objective of account expansion; We can trigger an engagement designed to alert a sales rep for  client overages, or generate engagement that targets new buying centers in adjacent organizations or new  business units or geographies.

The vendor’s strategy is to  leverage its in-house CDP, DSP, open APIs, and its 2019 acquisition of Growlabs to deliver advertizing to known  and anonymous B2B audiences. It is a good utility for B2B marketers who use advertizing in combination with  marketing platforms like HubSpot, Marketo, or Pardot. 
Through 2022, Rollworks continually enhanced its offering with these highlights: Creating a new standard in  intent data with the debut of Keyword Intent; deeper CRM integrations with the launch of RollWorks Journey  Events for HubSpot® and Journey Events for Salesforce; launch of Sales Insights for HubSpot (it now has over  
500 HubSpot Integration Installs, 150% more than the nearest ABM competitor); plus several advertizing  innovations with Account List Builder, Pixel Assistant, and Site Traffic Revealer.  
› Market Momentum 
Here, we have assessed how well a vendor helps prospective buyers to understand the  
solution offering and how it fits into their environment. Vendors scoring highly in this  category will have an extensive team, or a network of business partners, of knowledgeable  pre-sales consultants or advisors. 
› Customer Focus 
Almost all software is now delivered as-a-service and the most successful SaaS vendors are  those who help their clients on an ongoing basis, not just in response to support calls. They  invest heavily in customer success resources including dedicated staffing and management  attention as well as information and training around the solution. 
› Price vs Value 
As with any business investment, marketing executives need to be assured that the investments  they make in technology are providing an appropriate payback. At the minimum, vendors  can help their clients calculate the return-on-investment after a period of time. More mature  SaaS vendors are now providing value management consulting and processes for a more  continuous evaluation. 
› Implementation Success 
The true test of a business partnership is the commitment from a vendor to supporting the  integration of their system with whatever the client has in place already. This attention to  integration detail results not only in a smoother overall system, with no media breaks, but also  ideal user adoption and application longevity.
