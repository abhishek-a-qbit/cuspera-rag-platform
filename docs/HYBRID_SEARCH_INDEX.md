## 📝 Key Concepts

### Three Scores
Every result includes:
- **combined_score**: Weighted average (use this for ranking)
- **semantic_score**: Embedding similarity (conceptual understanding)
- **keyword_score**: BM25 relevance (explicit term matching)

### Configurable Weights
```python
VectorStore(semantic_weight=0.6, keyword_weight=0.4)  # Default
VectorStore(semantic_weight=0.7, keyword_weight=0.3)  # More semantic
VectorStore(semantic_weight=0.4, keyword_weight=0.6)  # More keyword
```

### Backward Compatible
```python
# Old code still works
vs = VectorStore()  # Now uses hybrid by default
vs.retrieve(query)  # Returns results with all scores
```

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before using in production, verify:

- [x] Read appropriate documentation for your role
- [x] Run `python test_hybrid_search.py` successfully
- [x] Understand the three score types
- [x] Configured weights appropriately
- [x] Tested with sample queries
- [x] API integration working
- [x] Performance acceptable
- [x] Backward compatibility confirmed
