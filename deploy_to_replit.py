🚀 DEPLOY MOCK API TO REPLIT (Free Public URL)

📋 STEPS:
1. Go to https://replit.com
2. Click "Create Repl" → "Python"
3. Copy the mock_api.py content to the new Repl
4. Click "Run" button
5. Copy the public URL (looks like: https://yourname.repl.co)
6. Use that URL in Streamlit Cloud

🌐 Your Streamlit Cloud Settings:
- API_URL: https://yourname.repl.co
- GOOGLE_API_KEY: Your actual Google Gemini API key

✅ This gives you a working public API that matches your backend structure!
